<h4 id="UsingGitHubtoDevelopATutor-UsingGitHub">Using GitHub</h4>

  <p>The ATutor source code is maintained in a GitHub repository, a public version
  control system that provides "Social Coding" capabilities, making it relatively easy
  for ATutor developers to have work added to ATutor's public source code. Developers
  will need to become familiar with Git and GitHub if they wish to participate in ATutor
  development. There is plenty of documentation on using Git and GitHub. You might read
  through the book at Git Pro, or review the GitHub Help documentation.</p>

  <h5 id="UsingGitHubtoDevelopATutor-4.1SettingupaGitDevelopmentEnvironment">4.1 Setting
  up a Git Development Environment</h5>

  <p>Though there are a variety of Git client applications available, working from a
  command prompt issuing Git commands is relatively easy to learn. Knowing a small set of
  Git commands is all you required to get up and running, and contributing code through
  GitHub.</p>

  <p>For Mac users there is <a href="http://mac.github.com/" class="external-link" rel=
  "nofollow">GitHub for Mac</a>, which can be installed to setup Git on your Mac. It
  provides a graphical client through which GitHub can be accessed.</p>

  <p>Windows users have a variety of GitHub clients available. A quick search will turn
  up many. One popular client for Windows is <a href=
  "http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/index.html" class="external-link" rel=
  "nofollow">SmartGit</a>. Another is <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/" class=
  "external-link" rel="nofollow">Cygwin</a></p>

  <p>Linux users also have a variety of Github clients available, such as <a href=
  "http://cola.tuxfamily.org/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Git Cola</a> or
  <a href="http://live.gnome.org/giggle" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Giggle</a>,
  among others. And, of course, if you prefer to just work from the command prompt, just
  install git itself. Most, probably all, Linux systems have a Git package available that
  can be installed through their package management system. On Ubuntu or Debian for
  instance, as the root user issue the command apt-get install git at the command
  prompt.</p>

  <h5 id="UsingGitHubtoDevelopATutor-4.2CreatingandMaintainingaGitFork">4.2 Creating and
  Maintaining a Git Fork</h5>

  <p>All developers outside the core development team will work in their own fork of the
  ATutor source code located on GitHub. Creating a fork is pretty straight forward. Once
  your <a href="https://github.com/plans" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Github
  account</a> is setup, and you have logged in, search for the <a href=
  "https://github.com/atutor/ATutor" class="external-link" rel=
  "nofollow">atutor/ATutor</a> repository. At the top of the screen while viewing the
  repository, click on the "Fork" button to create a fork of the master source code. You
  will now have a copy of the source code linked to your account, something like
  <a class="unresolved" href="#">username</a>/ATutor, where <a class="unresolved" href=
  "#">username</a> is your GitHub login.</p>

  <p>Now you will want to clone the fork you created into your local development
  environment. Using your Git client you can then find its "clone" features to generate a
  local copy, or at the command prompt issue the following commands:</p>

  <p>Perform these operations often</p>

git checkout master                                             // switch to the local master branch
git pull upstream master                                        // update your local master branch with code from the main ATutor repository
git checkout new_feature                                        // switch to the local new_feature branch

</pre>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>After pulling from the ATutor master repository, review the latest SQL upgrade file
  to ensure your database structure is up-to-date (in the install/db/ directory ). The
  file will contain schema changes of the current pre-released source. Example: If the
  current working source will be version 1.9, then the upgrade file to keep track of will
  be named atutor_upgrade_x.y.z_to_1.9.sql, where x.y.z is the version of the currently
  available stable release.</p>
