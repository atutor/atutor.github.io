<h2>ATutor User Handbook</h2>
<p>Welcome to the ATutor General User documentation. The information found here is applicable to both instructors and students. Also see the the <strong><u>Instructor Documentation</u></strong> for details of other tools that might be used to author content while in a group environment. </p>

<h2>Login</h2>

<p>A user may login to the system with the Login Name or Email address, and the Password entered during <strong><u>registration</u></strong>. Logging in gives users access to Protected courses, lets them enroll, and lets them participate in courses.</p>


<h2>Register</h2>

<p>In order for a user to login to the ATutor system, a unique system account needs to be created.  Use the <em>Register</em> link in the main navigation to access the registration form. If email-confirmation has been enabled by the system administrator, a message will be sent to the email address entered, containing a link that must be followed to confirm the new account. Once this has been done, the login name or email address, and the password entered during registration can now be used on the <strong><u>Login</u></strong> screen.</p>

<p>Note that if a system administrator has specified users to be checked against a Master List of allowed Student IDs and PINs (for example), this information must also be entered during registration.</p>


<h2>Browse Courses</h2>

<p>The Browse Courses page lists all  courses presently available on the ATutor system.</p>  

<p>If a course is Public, it may be accessed without logging in first. Protected and Private courses require that you be logged in. Private courses are available only to those who have been approved and enrolled in the course.</p>


<h2>Forgot Your Password</h2>

<p>If you have forgotten your password, use the <em>Forgot your password?</em> link on the Login screen. The form will email the login name to you, along with a link you must follow to change your password.</p>


<h2>My Start Page</h2>

<p><em>My Start Page</em> is a personal area displayed after logging in. The My Courses section lists the courses that the user either teaches, or is enrolled in. From here one can also create a new course, or browse through courses. There is also a <strong><u>Profile</u></strong> section for editing personal details (including changing a password or an email address), and a <strong><u>Preferences</u></strong> section for editing some system preferences such as the way information is displayed and the preferred theme. </p>


<h2>My Courses</h2>
<p>Courses that the user is in enrolled in, or courses that are pending enrollment, are listed on the <em>My Courses</em> page.</p>

<p>To enroll into a public or protected course, follow the <em>Browse Courses</em> link and locate it, then enter the course and use the <em>Enroll Me</em> link located beside the course title. If the course is private, enrollment must be requested first. Admission into the course will be allowed once the instructor has approved the request.</p>


<h2>Create Course</h2>

<p>Only Instructors may create courses,  though if enabled,  students can request instructor accounts by selecting the Create Course link. View the <strong><u>Instructor Documentation</u></strong> on creating courses.</p>


<h2>Profile</h2>
<p>This section allows a user to change elements of his/her personal profile.</p>

<p>Although the login name cannot be altered, password, email address, and other personal information may be edited. There is also an option to keep the email address hidden.</p>


<h2>Preferences Wizard</h2>
<p>At any time (except while viewing the Preferences screen) the Preferences Wizard can be opened by clicking the wand icon next to your login name to the upper right (location may vary across themes). Any of the settings you can set through the Preferences panels described below, can also be set using the wizard.</p>

<h3>Content Settings</h3>
<p>These settings are used to control which versions of content are displayed, if for example the primary version is not accessible to you, or you prefer an alternate format. These settings will be ignored if the alternative versions you prefer are not available with the content you are viewing. Instructors and content authors should review <strong><u>Alternate Content</u></strong> for information on including alternate formats with ATutor content.</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Alternatives to Text</dt>
    <dd>If you are a person with a print related disability, or you prefer content in mutli-modal forms, select from these options to have alternate forms either replace text versions of the content, or have the alternate forms appended to the content.</dd>

    <dt>Alternatives to Audio</dt>

<dl>
    <dt>Navigation</dt>
    <dd>Choose to show a <strong>Table of Contents</strong> at the top of each content page that can be used to navigate to sub sections within the page. Note that a Table of Contents is generated based on the headings (i.e. HTML H1 to H6), so it is important for content authors to structure their content properly with appropriate headings and sub-headings.</dd>
    <dd>Choose to show <strong>Next/Previous Navigation</strong>  links to aid navigation through content in the order pages are intended to be viewed, or to provide quick access back to the content page you left off on, when you return to viewing content in a current or future session.</dd>

    <dd>Choose to display <strong>Breadcrumb Navigation</strong> at the top of every page to provide up and down navigation through hierarchies of topics and sub-topics, or to keep a display of your current location within ATutor in view at all times.</dd>

</dl>


<h2>Inbox</h2>
<p>The Inbox is used for privately messaging other users in your courses. Inbox messages appear in a table, with new messages flagged. Selecting a message will display its contents at the top of the screen.</p>

<p>In the sub-navigation there is a link to send a message. Choose the recipient, enter a subject and a message, and use the <code>Send</code> button. </p>

<p>Note: use the <em>Inbox Notification</em> <strong><u>preference</u></strong> to receive emails when a new Inbox message is received.</p>


<h2>Course Features</h2>

<p>After a student has entered into a course, he/she is presented with the course Home page. The Home page may contain a course banner, links to Student Tool, and course announcements. </p>

<p>A few of the course features are explained here, as they may be a little tricky for new users. Other features are fairly straight forward and should be intuitive to use. Look for the handbook link while using a tool, to open its help page directly.</p>


<h2>Export Content</h2>

<p>The Export Content feature creates a "Content Package" that can be downloaded and viewed offline in the viewer included with each package. If  this feature is turned on for a course, it may be accessed through a Student Tool icon on the home page, and/or a link in the main navigation. Choose which section you wish to download as a content package the use the <code>Export</code> button. <em>Export Content</em> is also linked from top level content pages or all content pages (depending on what the instructor has set) in the Shortcuts box.  Using this link will package the current page and all of its sub pages into a single "zip" file, and prompt the user to download the file.</p>

<p>The downloaded file can be unpacked with a common archiving application (e.g. WinZip, PKZip, Unzip). Unzip the file into an empty directory then open the <kbd>index.html</kbd> file into a Web browser. </p>


<h2>Packages</h2>

<p>If instructors have included SCORM compliant Sharable Content Objects (SCOs), they will be avilable for viewing using the <em>Packages</em> tool. Note that the SCORM Run Time Environment (RTE) requires the Java JRE 1.5 to function properly, as well as LiveConnect, which is enabled by default in the JRE 1.5. Download an install with <strong><u>latest Java JRE</u></strong> [java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp] from the SUN site, if you need to upgrade your browser's java support.</p>



<h2>TILE Repository Search</h2>

<p>External content packages can be downloaded from the TILE repository by entering a search term and using the <code>Search</code> button.  Use the <em>Preview</em> link next to a search result to open the TILE content browser, or use <em>Download</em> to retrieve the content package from the TILE repository. Once downloaded, the file can be unpacked with a common archiving application (e.g. WinZip, PKZip, Unzip). Unzip the file into an empty directory and browse the package's content. </p>

<p>Visit the <strong><u>TILE web site</u></strong> [www.inclusivelearning.ca/] for more information about using the repository.</p>

<h2>File Storage</h2>

<p>Students, assistants, and instructors can access a personal file management tool using the <em>File Storage</em> area, if enabled for a course. Workspaces can be selected for storing files,  their presence depending on one's access rights:
	</p><ul>
		<li><em>Course Files</em> - The default workspace. Managed by the instructor, or assistants with file storage privileges, course resource files are made available for download by course members.</li>
		<li><em>My Files</em> - Private files only the user can access and manage.</li>
		<li><em>Groups</em> - Shared files managed by group members, and accessible to instructors and assistants with group privileges.</li>

<p></p>
<h3>Create Folders and Adding Files</h3>
<p>To organize files, folders can be created using the <em>Create Folder</em> feature at the top right of the file area. To upload a new file, with an optional description of its contents, use the <em>New File</em> feature at the top left. The file will be uploaded to the currently opened directory.</p>

<h3>Managing Files</h3>
<p>It is also possible to <code>Download</code> files to your hard drive, <code>Hand In</code> a file for an assignment, <code>Edit</code> file details and rename folders,  <code>Move</code> files around within a workspace, as well as <code>Delete</code> files and folders. Depending on the type of workspace, the buttons that appear will vary.</p>

<h3>File Revisions</h3>

<p>If enabled, file revisions can be kept, so a history of the document or file is available. Uploading a file of the same name as one that exists, will create a second version of the file, and so on. With each revision comments can be added, to summarize the changes from authors, and to perhaps collect feedback from reviewers.</p>

<h2>File Storage - New/Edit File</h2>

Details include file name, file size, a thumbnail of the image, and a delete button.  The delete button allows you to remove the pending photos anytime during the upload process.
