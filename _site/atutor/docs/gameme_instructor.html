<h2>GameMe Instructor Documentation</h2>
<h3 id="GameMe1.0InstructorDocumentation-UsingGameMe">Using GameMe</h3>

  <p>GameMe is used to add game elements to ATutor courses. When turned on in a course
  students can earn points, progress through levels, and earn badges for their
  accomplishments. Clues for earning bonus points and badges can accompany alerts sent to
  students when they earn a badge, or complete a particular task. Instructors, can enable
  points, badges, levels, and a leaders board to add a game feel to their courses. When
  enabled, students can review their GameMe Log to see where points are earned, point
  values for particular activities, where badges are issued, giving them a ways to
  maximize their rewards. Instructors can encourage particular behaviour by assigning
  higher point values to more valued activities, or assigning higher values to activities
  that students might need "encouragement" to participate in. Messaging with game
  elements can be customized to guide students through your course, or to encourage
  particular behavoiurs.</p>

  <h3 id="GameMe1.0InstructorDocumentation-CustomizingCourseEvents,Badges,andLevels">
  Customizing Course Events, Badges, and Levels</h3>

  <p>The ATutor administrator needs to enable customizing to allow instructors to edit
  the default settings. When enabled instructors can customized the default events,
  badges, and levels ('game elements' collectively). Only administrators have the ability
  to create new game elements, if they are needed.</p>

  <p>There may be no need to modify the default settings for game elements, but that will
  depend on the length of a course, the number of Course Tools enabled, and how those
  tools are used (e.g. optional, required, for exploration, or as part of a course
  activity). GameMe events are associated with various actions that occur in ATutor, like
  logging in, uploading a profile picture, making a blog entry, answering a forum post,
  and so on. If you choose not to modify the default settings for game elements, those
  setting will be used in the course.</p>

  <p>When GameMe is enabled in a course, the instructor also collects points and badges,
  and progresses through levels. This can be helpful in judging the points to assign for
  events,&nbsp; judging how fast they accumulate to reach various levels (more on levels
  below), and to see what students might see when they are participating. You'll also
  receive email alerts when you earn badges, seeing what students might see when they
  receive alerts. With this knowledge in hand, you can adjust the GameMe settings to
  optimize game elements for a particular course. When adjusting game element settings,
  they should be set up so students can realistically reach the upper levels, and it is
  realistically possible to earn each of the badges by performing well in the course.</p>

  <h3 id="GameMe1.0InstructorDocumentation-Events">Events</h3>

  <p>There are 38 default events with GameMe that can be edited using the Instructor
  <strong>GameMe Events</strong> <strong>Editor</strong>. The fields in the editor are
  described in this section:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Alias</strong> - (string) A short identifier used as a reference to
    access an events properties. Alphabetic, underscores, no spaces. (only editable by
    admin user)</li>

    <li><strong>Description&nbsp;</strong>- (string) A few words to describe the event to
    users</li>

    <li><strong>Repetition</strong> - (integer)&nbsp; Set to 1 to disable repetitions,
    allowing an event to occur only once. Set to 0 to allow an event to reoccur</li>

    <li><strong>Reach Reps</strong> -&nbsp; (integer) The number of times an event needs
    to repeat before triggering a reach event</li>

    <li><strong>Max Points</strong> &nbsp; - (integer) The maximum number of points a
    repeatable event can accumulate</li>

    <li><strong>Each Badge</strong>&nbsp; - (integer) The id number of the badge issued
    each time an event occurs, typically for single occurence events&nbsp;</li>

    <li><strong>Reach Badge</strong>&nbsp; -&nbsp;(integer) The id of the badge issued
    when a reach event occurs &nbsp;</li>

    <li><strong>Each Point</strong>&nbsp; - (integer) The number of points issued each
    time an event occurs</li>

    <li><strong>Reach Points</strong>&nbsp; -&nbsp;(integer) The number of bonus points
    issued when a reach event occurs &nbsp;</li>

    <li><strong>Reach Message</strong>&nbsp; - (string) The content of the message to
    send to a user when a reach event occurs</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="GameMe1.0InstructorDocumentation-CustomizingEvents">Customizing Events</h4>

  <p>When opened for the first time, the GameMe Events Editor will show an empty list of
  <strong>Course Events</strong> above, and all the available <strong>Default
  Events</strong> below. You can leave the Default Events as they are, or you can copy
  them into your Course Events to customize them. At the far right of each Default Event
  is a copy link, that when clicked adds the event to the Course Events (you may need to
  scroll right to see it). Once copied the Course Events become editable by clicking, or
  tabbing,&nbsp; into a cell, and editing the contents. Click or Tab away from the cell
  to save the edited value. Clicking on the <strong>Remove</strong> link to the far right
  of a Course Event, deletes the customized Course Event and reverts back to the Default
  Event corresponding with the removed event.</p>

  <p>Scan through the events to see how <strong>Each Events</strong> and <strong>Reach
  Events</strong> are used. Typically Each Events are used to issue points, and Reach
  Events are used to issue badges and bonus points. Reach Events occur when an event
  reaches a particular number of repetitions. Instructors can enable and disable
  <strong>Repetition</strong> by assigning a value of 1 (no repetition) or 0 (allow
  repetition), and adjust the number of repetitions to reach the Reach Event by modifying
  the&nbsp;<strong>Reach Reps</strong> value.</p>

  <p>If necessary a <strong>Max</strong> <strong>Points</strong> value can be set to
  limit the number of points a student can earn for repeating a particular event, after
  which for example, there is no additional learning value. For instance, after uploading
  20 photos to a Photo Gallery, stop giving points to encourage keeping albums small. If
  a photo upload <strong>Each Points</strong> is worth 25 points, limit the Max Points
  that can be scored to 500 in this case. Each Points are the number of points awarded
  each time an event occurs, and <strong>Reach Points</strong> are optional bonus points
  that can be granted when a Reach Event occurs.</p>

  <p>Instructors may also alter the badges given for each and reach events. The
  <strong>Each Badge</strong> and <strong>Reach Badge</strong> values are the ID values
  of the associated badges. More about badges, and badge IDs in the Customizing Badges
  section below.</p>

  <p>Typically when a badge is earned, an email is sent to the student containing the new
  badge, and a list of previously earned badges, along with a message often with
  congratulations, or perhaps clues for earning additional&nbsp; points or badges.
  Instructors can edit the <strong>Reach Message</strong> to customize the email,
  providing whatever added encouragement is needed, mentioning added rewards (i.e. points
  and badge) to elicit particular behaviours within the course, steering students to the
  next task, or perhaps provide clues or hints to help with a quiz that follows. Modify
  the Reach Message as needed to control where, and how students interact with elements
  of the course.</p>

  <h3 id="GameMe1.0InstructorDocumentation-Badges">Badges</h3>

  <p>There are 26 default badges with GameMe, each associated with a particular each or
  reach event. Instructors can edit the default badges using the <strong>Badge
  Editor</strong>. The fields in the editor are described in this section:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Badge</strong> -&nbsp;(string) The badge image preview and dropzone,
    stores the relative path to the badge image in the database</li>

    <li><strong>Id</strong> - (integer) The id number assigned to the badge, referred to
    in the each badge and reach badge fields in the <strong>Events Editor</strong></li>

    <li><strong>Alias</strong> - (string) A short identifier used as a reference to
    access a badge's properties. Alphabetic, underscores, no spaces. (only editable by
    admin user)</li>

    <li><strong>Title</strong> - (string)&nbsp; A short name for the badge (1-3 words
    typically)</li>

    <li><strong>Description&nbsp;</strong>- (string) A sentence or two that describes to
    the recipient why they received the badge.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="GameMe1.0InstructorDocumentation-CustomizingBadges">Customizing Badges</h4>

  <p>Much like customizing events described above, instructors can copy <strong>Default
  Badges</strong> and customize them as <strong>Course Badges</strong> using the
  <strong>GameMe Badge Editor</strong>. Like events, if a Course Badge is removed, the
  badge will revert to the corresponding default badge.</p>

  <p>Once a Default Badge is copied the first cell of the now Course Badge displays a
  preview of the badge, and acts as a <strong>Badge Dropzone</strong> for modifying the
  badge image. You may replace the default badges with your own custom badges, by
  dragging a maximum <strong>95px x 95px badge image, less than 15k</strong> in size into
  the dropzone. Or, you may click on a dropzone to open your local file manager and chose
  a badge image that way.</p>

  <p>The <strong>Id</strong> field contains the reference number you will use when
  referring to a badge in the Each Badge and Reach Badge fields in the GameMe Event
  Editor. The ID field cannot be edited. The <strong>Alias</strong> is a short identifier
  for a badge, which can only be modified by the ATutor administrator.</p>

  <p>Instructors may modify the <strong>Title</strong> and the
  <strong>Description</strong> of a badge as needed, to customize the wording associated
  with a badge to match the goals and needs of the course. The title is essentially the
  name of the badge. It provides a short description of the badge's purpose. The
  Description provides a longer explanation of the badge and why is was issued.</p>

  <h3 id="GameMe1.0InstructorDocumentation-Levels">Levels</h3>

  <p>There are 11 default levels with GameMe, each associated with reaching a particular
  point value. Instructors can edit the default levels using the <strong>GameMe Level
  Editor</strong>. The fields in the editor are described in the section:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Icon</strong> -&nbsp;(string) The badge image preview and dropzone,
    storing the path to the icon image in the database</li>

    <li><strong>Level Name</strong> - (integer) A short name for the level (1-3 word,
    e.g. Level 1, Newbee, Novice Member, Superstar)</li>

    <li><strong>Description</strong> - (string) A few words describing the level that was
    reached</li>

    <li><strong>Points Threshold</strong> - (integer)&nbsp; The level Icon is issued to
    users when they reach this number of points</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="GameMe1.0InstructorDocumentation-CustomizingLevels">Customizing Levels</h4>

  <p>Much like customizing events and badges, instructors can copy the <strong>Default
  Levels</strong> and customize them as <strong>Course Levels</strong> using the
  <strong>GameMe Levels Editor</strong>. Of the three primary game elements (events,
  badges, levels), levels are the most likely to need adjusting, particularly the
  <strong>Points Threshold</strong> for each level. Students should be able to advance
  through most or all the levels in a course with good participation, given the duration
  of the course, and the number of Course Tools being used. If there are only a couple
  tools being used, you will likely need to adjust the point thresholds down so it is
  possible to earn enough point to advance through the levels in a course. While if there
  are many tools being used, you may need to adjust the points threshold up, so students
  don't advance through levels too quickly and reach the top levels well before the
  course is complete. If you prefer, you can edit the Each Point values in the
  <strong>Event Editor</strong>, higher so points accumulate faster, or lower so points
  accumulate more slowly.</p>

  <p>Instructors may also choose to modify the icon that gets displayed when each level
  is reached, by dragging a new, maximum dimensions of <strong>95px x 95px level image,
  less than 15k</strong> in size, into the <strong>Icon</strong> dropzone. Instructors
  may also modify the <strong>Title</strong> and the <strong>Description</strong> for a
  level as needed to match the goals or needs of the course.</p>

  <h3 id="GameMe1.0InstructorDocumentation-GameMeOptions">GameMe Options</h3>

  <p>Instructors can control which GameMe elements are enabled in a course using the
  <strong>GameMe Options Editor</strong>. When an option is checked, it is displayed to
  students either in a <strong>Side Menu Block</strong>, or in the <strong>GameMe
  Panel</strong> that gets added as a main navigation tab. Instructors can enable the
  sidemenu and main navigation Tab in the <strong>Course Tools</strong>
  <strong>Manager</strong>, much like adding any other course tool to an ATutor course.
  Each the available options are described in this section.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><label for="showpoints"><strong>Points</strong></label> - Allow student to
    accumulate points, and display them in the side menu and GameMe panel if they are
    enabled in a course</li>

    <li><label for="showlog"><strong>Log</strong></label> - Allow students to view a log
    of the events they have triggered. This can allow students to strategize to earn more
    point and badges by seeing how they are being earned</li>

    <li><label for="showlevels"><strong>Levels</strong></label> - When enabled, students
    see the levels they have progressed through, either in the side menu or GameMe
    panel</li>

    <li><strong>Progress to next level</strong> - If Levels are enabled, you may choose
    to display to students the progress they have made to reaching the next level as a
    percentage value</li>

    <li><label for="showposition"><strong>Position relative to others</strong></label> -
    If the leader board is enabled, you may choose to display to students their points
    position relative to others in the course.</li>

    <li><label for="showbadges"><strong>Badges</strong></label> - When enable, students
    see a list of badges they have earned, either in the side menu or GameMe panel.</li>

    <li><label for="showinstructor"><strong>Show instructor in leader
    board</strong></label> - An instructor may choose to have his or her points listed in
    the leader board. You will generally want to disable this option so your points do
    not show up in the leader board</li>

    <li><label for="showleaders"><strong>Leader Board</strong></label> - Attach a leader
    board to the side menu or GameMe panel so students can see the points the top
    students have earned.</li>

    <li><label for="showalerts"><strong>Alerts</strong></label> - Allow students to see a
    record of the reach events and levels earned</li>

    <li><label for="show_leaders"><strong>Leader board length</strong></label> - Choose
    how many students to display in the leader board</li>

    <li><label for="level_count"><strong>Number of levels (max 11)</strong></label> -
    Choose from the default levels, how many levels to have in a course.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Note that when GameMe elements are disabled, they are still running in the
  background, though not visible to students.</p>

  <h3 id="GameMe1.0InstructorDocumentation-Progress">Progress</h3>

  <p>Under the Progress tab in the instructor's GameMe editor, the points, badges, and
  levels for each student in the course can be viewed. Select a student from the drop
  down menu, and press the View button to see that person GameMe progress.</p>
