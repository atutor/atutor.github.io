<h2>ATutor Features</h2>
<p>The following is a relatively detailed list of the standard features in ATutor. Also see the <a href="/atutor/modules/index.php">Modules </a> for additional features and third party add-on software. </p>

<h3>Learners</h3>
<div class="to_top"><a href="#top" class="up-arrow">Top</a></div>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: ATutor was designed with accessibility as a priority. A wide range of features ensure assistive technology users can participate fully in learner, instructor, and administrative activities.  DIV based themes are available for added accessibility. ATutor conforms with international accessibility standards.  IMS/ISO AccessForAll support allows learners to configure the environment and content to their specific needs.</li>	

	<li><strong>Social Networking</strong>:  All ATutor users can develop a network of contacts, create and join interest groups, setup a network profile, and link any of the thousands of remote gadget applications into their networking environment. Photos can be shared across courses, or through the social networking area.  </li>

	<li><strong>Things Current</strong>:  When a student or instructor logs into My Start Page, a list of all current information is presented, providing quick access to ongoing activity in their courses. </li>

	<li><strong>Security</strong>:  Login passwords are encrypted. Forgotten passwords must be reset, rather than retrieved by email, removing the possibility they might be intercepted when being sent over the Internet. </li>

	<li><strong>My Courses</strong> : Instructors and students can manage the ATutor courses they teach and/or are enrolled in.  When a student registers they are automatically logged into My Courses.</li>

	<li><strong>Inbox/Messaging</strong> :  All users on an ATutor system have an Inbox, through which they can send and receive private messages from other users.  Messages sent are saved to Sent Messages, which remain for a set period before being deleted. Messages can be exported and saved externally. </li>

	<li><strong>Student Profile</strong> : Students can add personal information about themselves for others to see,  and include a profile picture, which is also displayed with forum posts. The photo gallery can be used to create a profile album, where a collection of profile pictures can be stored.</li>

	<li><strong>Adaptive Navigation</strong>: Learners can move through ATutor content using global, hierarchical, or sequential navigation tools.  Navigation elements can be hidden to simplify the environment.</li>

	<li><strong>Work Groups</strong>:  Learners can collaborate with others on course projects, communicate as a group through the forums, share resources using the File Storage utility, and work together authoring project documents. Exercises or assignments can be submitted to a group leader, or course instructor. </li>
	
	<li><strong>File Storage</strong>:  All users on an ATutor system have their own file storage utility. File storage areas can also be shared across groups, or an entire course. Version control can be enabled to keep track of drafts or changes to documents. </li>

	<li><strong>Group Blogs</strong>:  Each group has access to their own blog, to which they can post public messages, available to all course member, or private messages, available only to group members and instructors.
