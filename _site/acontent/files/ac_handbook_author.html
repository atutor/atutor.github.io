<h2>Welcome to AContent</h2>

<p>Use the Search field to find learning content in the AContent 
Repository, or choose from the Categories to browse the  list of lessons
 available in each category. In the lessons that appear in Search 
Results or by browsing, click on a lesson title to view the lesson, or 
click on the download icon to export the lesson as a standard IMS 
Content Package.  </p>

<p>Unzip Content Packages then click on the <strong>index.html</strong> file to view the content on your local computer.</p>

<p>Content packages, in their zipped state, can be imported into systems that support the IMS Content Packaging standard.</p><h2>Register</h2>

<p>In order for a user to login to AContent and create content, manage 
translations, or administer the system, a unique  account needs to be 
created.  Use the <em>Register</em> link  to access the registration 
form. If email-confirmation has been enabled by the system 
administrator, a message will be sent to the email address entered 
containing a link that must be followed to confirm the new account. Once
 this has been done, the login name or email address, and the password 
entered during registration can be used to Login.</p>

<p>In addition to searching, downloading, and viewing content, available to non-registered users, a <strong>basic account</strong> allows users to add lessons to their account, and store them as bookmarks for future reference.</p>

<p>When registering, you can also request <strong>authoring privileges</strong> by choosing <strong>I would like to author content.</strong>
 Additional personal information is required when registering as an 
author, so content is properly attributed to an author. When the 
system's administrator has approved your author request, the Create 
Lesson tab will appear, which leads to the AContent authoring tools.</p><h2>Login</h2>

<p>A user may login to AContent with their Login Name or Email address, 
and the Password created during registration. Logging in gives users 
access to the bookmark feature for <strong>Regular users</strong>, and to the authoring tools for <strong>Author users</strong>.</p><h2>Password Reminder</h2>

<p>If you have forgotten your password, follow the <em>Forgot your password?</em> link on the Login screen. The form will email the login name to you, along with a link you must follow to change your password.</p><h3>Profile</h3>

<p>Once you have registered an account on the system, a Profile is 
created. You may modify the information associated with your profile, 
though you may not change your Login name, or the generated Web Service 
ID. If you are requesting a content authoring account, you must provide 
additional information about who you are so content is properly 
attributed to an author.</p>

<h3>Web Service ID</h3>
<p>The Web Service ID is a unique identifier that can be used to link 
other systems with AContent through its Web Services. This ID will be 
useful for developers creating systems that access AContent Web 
Services, or to administrators of learning management systems who wish 
to link AContent into their LMS. ATutor administrators can enter the Web
 Service ID of any user in the AContent system, into the  AContent Setup
 screen to link the repository into their ATutor system. See the <strong>Web Service API</strong>, linked from the footer area of AContent for more about developing an interface to the system. </p><h2>Change Password</h2>
<p>This page allows users to change passwords. The form authenticates 
users by checking their old password first, and then setting a new 
password and typing it again.</p>
<h2>Change Email</h2>
<p>This page allows users to change email addresses. </p>
<h2>Create Lesson</h2>
<p>There are two ways to create a lesson, manually by defining course 
properties, and automatically by importing an existing IMS Content 
Package or IMS Common Cartridge.</p>

<h3>Manual Create Lesson</h3>
<p>Follow the "Create Lesson" link on the Create Lesson screen. Fill out
 the Lesson Properties screen then save. You will be directed into the 
lesson, after which you can add folders and content pages to the lesson.
 </p>
<h3>Import Lesson</h3>
<p>If you have an existing lesson, either created in ATutor, or created 
in another system that generates content packages or common cartridges, 
you can either upload the zipped file, or you can enter the URL to its 
location on the Web to import it. Once imported, use the content editing
 tools to modify the content.</p>

<h3>Hide Lesson</h3>
<p>While developing content it is advisable to select the "Hide lesson 
from other users" checkbox.  Once the lesson is ready for public 
viewing, change the setting in the lesson properties.</p><h3>Lesson Properties</h3>
<p>While viewing any folder of page in a lesson, click on the Lesson Properties icon (<img src="/images/course_property.png" alt="">) to modify the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Title</strong>: Write a few words to provide a short description of the lesson content.</li>
<li><strong>Category Name</strong>: Select from the available content 
categories, the one that best categorizes your lesson. If the category 
you need is not present, choose Uncategorized, or suggest a new category
 to the system's administrator.</li>
<li><strong>Primary Language</strong>: Choose from the available 
languages, the one your lesson is written in. Available languages are 
based on the languages installed on the system. To have additional 
languages installed, talk to your system administrator.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: This a longer description of the lesson, expanding on the description in the title.</li>
<li><strong>Optional Copyright Notice</strong>: Write a copyright notice to appear at the bottom of each page in the lesson.</li>
<li><strong>Hide Lesson</strong>: Select this checkbox if you want to 
prevent others from searching or viewing the lesson. This might be 
enabled while a lesson is being created, then disabled when a lesson is 
ready for distribution.</li>
</ul><h3>Manage Tests &amp; Surveys</h3>

<p>AContent provides tools for developing assessments to accompany 
content. Tests can also be created in a lesson space, then exported out 
in IMS QTI 1.2 format for importing into other systems that support the 
QTI standard. Question banks can also be created, authoring questions 
and exporting them as a batch of questions independent of any test.</p>

<p>Tests and questions can also be imported from other systems that 
produce QTI conformant tests or question banks, then associated with 
lesson content, later to be exported as part of a common cartridge.</p>

<h3>Test Manager Tools</h3>
<p>When tests exist for a lesson, they will be listed on the opening 
screen of Tests &amp; surveys, along with tools for managing the test. 
If no test appear, use <strong><a href="http://www.atutor.ca/acontent/devdemo/documentation/index.php?p=tests/create_test.php">Create Tests/Surveys</a></strong> to add one.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Edit</strong>: Choose the radio button next to a listed test, then press the Edit button to modify the test's title and description. </li>
<li><strong>Preview</strong>: Select the radio button next to a listed test to open it and preview how it will appear to learners.</li>
<li><strong>Questions</strong>: Select the radio button for a test, then
 press the Questions button to add or modify the questions associated 
with that test. If questions do not yet exist, go to the Question Bank 
to create or import questions before adding them to a test.</li>
<li><strong>Delete</strong>: Choosing a radio button next to a test, 
then pressing Delete removes the test from the system, but not the 
questions that may have been associated with that test. </li>
<li><strong>Export</strong>: Selecting a test then pressing Export, generates a QTI 1.2 test package for download and importing into other systems.</li>

</ul><h3>Create Tests/Surveys</h3>
<p>Creating a test begins by assigning a title to the test, and an 
optional description, which may include test instructions. Once these 
are written, save the test before adding questions to it. See <strong><a href="http://www.atutor.ca/acontent/devdemo/documentation/index.php?p=tests/index.php"> Tests &amp; Surveys</a></strong> for more about adding questions to a test, previewing, and editing tests.</p><h3>Edit Tests/Surveys</h3>
<p>Editing a test is much the same as Creating a test.  See <strong> <a href="http://www.atutor.ca/acontent/devdemo/documentation/index.php?p=tests/create_test.php">Create Tests/ Surveys</a></strong> for more about  editing tests.</p><h3>Add Question to a Test</h3>
<p>After selecting a test from the main Test &amp; Survey screen and 
pressing the Questions button to list the questions associated with that
 test, click on the Add Questions tab above to open the Question Bank. 
Either choose a category of questions to add to the test, or choose 
individual questions, then press <strong>Add to Test/Survey</strong> to 
add the questions. You will be redirected back to the question list for 
that test, at which time you must assign mark values to each question 
(unless you are creating a survey in which case questions have no mark 
value).</p><h3>Question Bank</h3>

<p>The Question Bank is where questions are created or imported before being associated with a test. You may want to create <strong><a href="http://www.atutor.ca/acontent/devdemo/documentation/index.php?p=tests/question_cats.php">Question Categories</a></strong>
 to add questions to before creating questions. Each question includes a
 space for defining optional feedback. Feedback appears with a marked 
test explaining the correct answers. Question types supported include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Likert (survey questions)</strong>: Choose from existing 
likert scales to populate a question, or define a custom scale of your 
own. Custom scales are  added to the presets for future reuse. Define a 
question, then include at least two choices to create a survey question.</li>
<li><strong>Matching (graphical)</strong>: Images and other graphical content that has been uploaded into the <strong><a href="http://www.atutor.ca/acontent/devdemo/documentation/index.php?p=file_manager/index.php">File Manager</a></strong> can be inserted into a graphical matching question. Click on the <strong>Editor</strong>
 link beside each question item to open the visual editor and File 
Manager to prepare the item, then press the Paste button to copy the 
HTML of the question item over to the question's textarea. </li>
<li><strong>Matching (simple)</strong>: Much like graphical matching questions, though in this case only text is used to define questions and answers.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Answer</strong>: These questions ask learners to 
choose at least one response to a question, but maybe more, choosing a 
number of checkboxes associated with multiple answers to the question. 
When creating a multiple answer question, check the <strong>Correct Answer</strong>
 checkbox beside each of the choices that are correct.  These questions 
are only marked correct if learners choose all the correct answers when 
responding to the question.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Choice</strong>: Much like Multiple Answer, though 
these questions ask learners to select only one correct answer.  When 
creating the question, choose  one <strong>Crrect Answer</strong> radio button.</li>
<li><strong>Open Ended (word, paragraph, page responses)</strong>: These
 questions generally ask learners to supply an free form answer by 
typing in a word, a sentence, a paragraph, or a page as their response. 
When creating the question, choose from the four formats to include a 
text area of appropriate size for the type of open ended response 
required.</li>
<li><strong>Ordering</strong>: Create items to be ordered in the 
question in the incorrect order. When displayed to learners, items in 
the question are presented in the order they were created. </li>
<li><strong>True or False</strong>: Write a statement for the question, then select whether that statement is true or false.</li>
</ul><h3>Question Categories</h3>

<p>Before creating questions it may be helpful to create a number of 
categories into which questions can be grouped. Categories might be as 
simple as "questions for test 1" so when the questions are to be added 
to the test, you may choose the category to have all the question added,
 instead of choosing questions one by one. Categories might also be used
 to define difficulty level, or perhaps topic area. Categories can 
define any type of grouping for questions.</p><h2>Create and Edit Content</h2>
<p>There are many ways content might be assembled into a lesson. 
Generally, content is created by adding folders to contain the content, 
and adding pages to folders on which the content is displayed. There are
 a variety of tools available to add folders and pages to a lesson. 
These tools are described below. The tools that appear at any given 
time, depend on context.</p>

<h3>Editor Icons</h3>
<ul>
<li><img src="/images/download.html" alt=""> Follow the <strong>Export Content</strong>
 icon to generate an IMS Content Package of the current page. Note, to 
export an entire lesson, use the export tools next to a lesson listing 
on your AContent home page, as either a content package or a common 
cartridge. </li>

<li><img src="/images/medit.gif" alt=""> Follow the <strong>Edit This Page</strong> icon to open the content editor for editing the page you are viewing.</li>

<li><img src="/images/addstruct.gif" alt=""> Follow the <strong>Add Structure</strong>
 icon to add a learning object structure to a lesson. Structures include
 such things as a goals page, a lesson overview, an assessment, or an 
activity for example. Some pages within a lesson structure are mandatory
 and cannot be deleted, while others are optional.</li>


<li><img src="/images/add_sibling_folder.gif" alt=""> Follow the <strong>Add Sibling Folder</strong> icon to add a folder at the same level in the content you are current located.</li>

<li><img src="/images/add_sub_folder.gif" alt=""> Follow the <strong>Add Sub Folder</strong> icon to add a sub folder to a folder you currently have open.</li>

<li><img src="/images/add_sibling_page.gif" alt=""> Follow the <strong>Add Sibling Page</strong> icon to add a content page at the same level in the content you are currently located.</li>

<li><img src="/images/add_sub_page.gif" alt=""> Follow the <strong>Add Sub Page</strong> icon while a folder is open, to add a content page into the folder.</li>

<li><img src="/images/page_delete.gif" alt=""> Follow the <strong>Delete This Page</strong>
 icon while viewing a folder or a content page, to delete it. If you 
delete a folder, all of the pages and folders it contains will also be 
deleted.</li>

<li><img src="/images/course_property.png" alt=""> Follow the <strong>Lesson Properties</strong>
 icon to modify various characteristics of the lesson being viewed 
including its title, category, language, description, copyright notice, 
and whether it is hidden or viewable by others.</li>

<li><img src="/images/arrange_content.gif" alt=""> Follow the <strong>Arrange Content</strong> icon to move folders and pages around within a lesson. </li>

<li><img src="/images/delete.gif" alt=""> Follow the <strong>Delete This Lesson</strong> icon to completely remove the lesson and all its content from the system. </li>

<li><img src="/images/exit.png" alt=""> Follow the <strong>Exit Lesson</strong> icon to leave the lesson area and return to your AContent home page. </li>

</ul>

<h3>The Content Editor</h3>
<p>The Content Editor is use the create content for a lesson. It include
 a number of tabs across the top, and a number of tools for working with
 your content.</p>

<h4> Editor Tabs</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content</strong>:  This is where most content development 
will occur. To create a content page, enter a title, choose the format, 
and add some content to the body area.
	<ul><span>Formatting</span>
	<li>Plain Text: Simply type into the body area. Text is displayed without any formatting </li>
	<li>HTML:  When selected, the visual editor is displayed in the body 
area. Type or paste your text into the visual editor, then use the 
various tools to format the text with headings, colour, layout, and 
other formatting features. Note the first button in the visual editor is
 used to toggle between simple and advanced modes. </li>
	<li>Web Link: This option allows you to enter a URL to an external Web page, and have is display as part of the lesson content. </li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Theme:</strong> When enabled by the AContent system 
administrator, a Theme can be selected to apply a graphic design to the 
content. When an author edits the content, by using the <strong>Theme</strong>
 tab in the content editor, he/she can select and apply graphic elements
 to a page. Such elements are implemented as CSS rules, setting, for 
instance, font-size, font-family, foreground and background colors, 
borders, italic and/or bold style, text alignment and so on, to be added
 to the page cascading over the default graphic design provided by the 
LCMS. A Theme can be applied to a single content page or to an entire 
lesson.</li>

<li><strong>Template:</strong> When enabled by the AContent system administrator, authors can use the <strong>Template</strong>
 tab to format the organization of content on a page. Page templates are
 much like predefined page organizations in word processing 
applications. The author can select the page organization from a set of 
predefined templates, then add or edit content in and around the chosen 
page organizations. Each page template is an HTML fragment, structured 
in conformance with HTML standards.</li>

<li><strong>Meta-data:</strong> Associate  keywords with the content 
page to make it easy to find when searched. Duplicate key words from the
 content to raise the ranking of the page when those keywords are 
searched, enter synonyms of words in the content, or enter words that 
otherwise describe  aspects of the content on that page such as grade 
level, language, or perhaps audience.</li>

<li><strong>Adapted Content</strong>: To accommodate a diverse 
population of learners, authors can include adaptations of their 
original content to make it more accessible to a broad range of people. 
For example, include a text or audio equivalent of an image or other 
visual content to make the content more accessible to blind or low 
vision learners. Add a sign language alternative for text or audio 
content to better accommodate deaf learners. Or, include an audio 
alternative for text to accommodate people with learning of reading 
disabilities.

When the Adapted Content tab is opened, it scans through the content of 
the page being edited and identifies any associated resource files and 
lists them as <strong>Original Resources</strong>.  First select the 
appropriate checkbox to define the original resource type, either 
auditory, textual, or visual. Then click on the <strong>Add</strong> 
buttons in the Alternatives columns, and select files from the File 
Manager to add as an alternative for the original resource. Upload the 
files if necessary, and click <strong>Use As Alternative</strong> to associate it as an equivalent for the original resource.</li> 

<li><strong>Tests:</strong> Choose from the available tests you've either imported or created, to associate them with the content page. </li>

</ul>

<h3>Content Editor Tools</h3>
<ul>
<li><img src="/images/preview.png" alt="">Use the Preview tool to open the content you are currently editing to view it before saving.</li>
<li><img src="/images/achecker.png" alt=""> Opening the
 Accessibility tool will evaluate your content for compliance with 
various international accessibility guidelines using the AChecker Web 
service. Note that there is also a smaller accessibility icon in the 
visual editor that performs the same function. </li>
<li><img src="/images/custom_head.png" alt="">Use the 
Scripts/CSS tool to add HTML content that would normally appear in the 
head area of an HTML document. This can include things like Javascript, 
 styles, a reference to a stylesheet, or perhaps HTML meta-data.</li>
<li><img src="/images/paste.png" alt="">Use the Paste 
tool to upload HTML files that you have created in an external HTML 
editor. These must be full HTML pages. Note that there is also a <strong>Paste from Word</strong> tool in the visual editor itself that can be used to take DOC files and convert them into ATutor content pages.</li>
<li><img src="/images/file-manager.png" alt="">Use the File tool to open the File Manager. Upload files into the file manager that are linked into your content, then use the <strong>Insert</strong> button beside a file to insert a link to it in your content page.</li>
</ul><h3>Edit Content Folder</h3>


<p>To create or edit a content folder, click on the edit icon (<img src="/images/medit.html" alt="">) or add folder icon(<img src="/images/add_sibling_folder.gif" alt="">), then simply edit a title for the folder.  Keep folder titles as short as possible.</p><h3>Arrange Content</h3>

<p>While viewing content in a lesson, click on the Arrange Content icon (<img src="/images/arrange_content.gif" alt="">)
 to move pages and folders around within that lesson. To move an item, 
select the radio button next to it, then use the before icon (<img src="/images/before.gif" alt="">) to move the selected item before another item, use the after icon (<img src="/images/after.gif" alt="">) to move an item after another item, or use the child of icon (<img src="/images/child_of.gif" alt="">) to move an item into a folder.</p><p></p><h3>Import/Export Content</h3>
<p>All the import and export content tools can be found in one place by following the Import/Export Content icon (<img src="/images/import_export.png" alt="">) while viewing any page or folder in a lesson.</p>

<h3>Export Content</h3>
<ol>
<li>In the Export section in the upper area of the screen select the portion of the lesson the export from the <strong>What to export</strong> menu. By default the entire lesson is exported.</li>
<li>Select the format to export, either an <strong>IMS Content Package</strong>, or an <strong>IMS Common Cartridge</strong>.
 The format you want to export will depend on the formats supported by 
the system you'll be importing the content into. Content packages 
include only the folders and content pages within a lesson. Common 
cartridges include that same content, but will also include tests and 
forum activities if they have been created for the content.</li>
<li>Choose to export the <strong>AccessForAll (AFA)</strong> adapted 
content with either the content package or common cartridge you export. 
AFA content will often include alternative formats for original content 
that gets presented to learners based on their personal preferences set 
in the system the content is imported into. For example, a blind person 
might chose to have text alternatives displayed instead of images, and a
 deaf person might choose to have sign language replace audio content. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Import Content</h3>

<ol>
<li>Use the <strong>Import Into</strong> to select the position within the existing content of a lesson to place the imported package or cartridge.</li>
<li>Choose to import available tests and AFA content by selecting the checkboxes by each. </li>
<li>Upload the zipped package or cartridge to import it. Note, that you 
may choose to import packages or cartridge that do not validate (vary 
from the standard). In some cases this is fine, but be aware that 
importing invalid content can create problems, such as introducing 
damaging files that have been included with content by malicious users, 
or content that is not recorded in the package or cartridge manifest may
 become orphaned when the content is delete, left behind as files no 
longer used but taking up space. </li>
<li>or, type the URL to a package or cartridge to import it directly from its location on the Web.</li>

</ol><h3>Edit Content Folder/Page</h3>
<p>Click on the delete folder/page icon (<img src="/images/page_delete.gif" alt="">) to remove a folder and all its sub folders and pages. Click "yes" to confirm the deletion. </p><h3>File Manager</h3>
<p>The File Manager is where all the files associated with a lesson are 
uploaded and stored.  It can be accessed from various places throughout 
the authoring environment so files can be added or associated with 
content or tests where needed. Main access to the File Manager is 
through the tab across the top of the screen while inside the authoring 
area. Popup file managers are available through the test question 
editors, and from the main content editor screen.</p>

<p>Use the <strong>Create Folder</strong> text field to create folders into which you can sort files for the lesson. </p>

<p>Use <strong>Create a New File</strong> to open the visual editor and create a new HTML file.</p>
<p>Use  <strong>Upload Files</strong> to select files from your local 
computer to add to a lesson. You may prefer to zip the files together 
before uploading, upload the zip file, then unzip that file once it is 
on the server. Note that illegal files will not be unzipped, nor can you
 upload such files. Illegal files are those that can potentially create 
security problems. These file types are defined by the system's 
administrator and can be adjusted if you need to upload one of these 
file types. Most content file types can be added to lessons, and most 
executable files are restricted. </p>
