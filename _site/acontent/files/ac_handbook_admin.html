        <h2>AContent Administrator Handbook</h2>

<p>Use the Search field to find learning content in the AContent 
Repository, or choose from the Categories to browse the  list of lessons
 available in each category. In the lessons that appear in Search 
Results or by browsing, click on a lesson title to view the lesson, or 
click on the download icon to export the lesson as a standard IMS 
Content Package.  </p>

<p>Unzip Content Packages then click on the <strong>index.html</strong> file to view the content on your local computer.</p>

<p>Content packages, in their zipped state, can be imported into systems that support the IMS Content Packaging standard.</p><br><br><h2>Register</h2>

<p>In order for a user to login to AContent and create content, manage 
translations, or administer the system, a unique  account needs to be 
created.  Use the <em>Register</em> link  to access the registration 
form. If email-confirmation has been enabled by the system 
administrator, a message will be sent to the email address entered 
containing a link that must be followed to confirm the new account. Once
 this has been done, the login name or email address, and the password 
entered during registration can be used to Login.</p>

<p>In addition to searching, downloading, and viewing content, available to non-registered users, a <strong>basic account</strong> allows users to add lessons to their account, and store them as bookmarks for future reference.</p>

<p>When registering, you can also request <strong>authoring privileges</strong> by choosing <strong>I would like to author content.</strong>
 Additional personal information is required when registering as an 
author, so content is properly attributed to an author. When the 
system's administrator has approved your author request, the Create 
Lesson tab will appear, which leads to the AContent authoring tools.</p><br><br><h2>Login</h2>

<p>A user may login to AContent with their Login Name or Email address, 
and the Password created during registration. Logging in gives users 
access to the bookmark feature for <strong>Regular users</strong>, and to the authoring tools for <strong>Author users</strong>.</p><br><br><h2>Password Reminder</h2>

<p>If you have forgotten your password, follow the <em>Forgot your password?</em> link on the Login screen. The form will email the login name to you, along with a link you must follow to change your password.</p><br><br><h3>Profile</h3>

<p>Once you have registered an account on the system, a Profile is 
created. You may modify the information associated with your profile, 
though you may not change your Login name, or the generated Web Service 
ID. If you are requesting a content authoring account, you must provide 
additional information about who you are so content is properly 
attributed to an author.</p>

<h3>Web Service ID</h3>
<p>The Web Service ID is a unique identifier that can be used to link 
other systems with AContent through its Web Services. This ID will be 
useful for developers creating systems that access AContent Web 
Services, or to administrators of learning management systems who wish 
to link AContent into their LMS. ATutor administrators can enter the Web
 Service ID of any user in the AContent system, into the  AContent Setup
 screen to link the repository into their ATutor system. See the <strong>Web Service API</strong>, linked from the footer area of AContent for more about developing an interface to the system. </p><br><br><h2>Change Password</h2>
<p>This page allows users to change passwords. The form authenticates 
users by checking their old password first, and then setting a new 
password and typing it again.</p>
<br><br><h2>Change Email</h2>
<p>This page allows users to change email addresses. </p>
<br><br><h2>User Management</h2>

	<p>This section allows administrators to manage all user accounts. Each
 user belongs to a user group to which privileges are assigned.</p>

<p>There are three types of default user groups that are created when 
AContent is installed. These are described below along with the default 
privileges associated with each groups. 
	</p><dl>
		<dt>Administrator</dt>
		<dd>Administrators have privileges to use the Home, manage users, languages and manage their own profile.</dd>
		<dt>Regular User</dt>
		<dd>Regular users have privileges to use the Home and manage their own profile.</dd>
		<dt>Translator</dt>
		<dd>Translators have privileges to use the Home, translate AContent 
terms from English to other languages, and to manage their own profile. 
The languages that can be used in the system are defined by users who 
have "Language Management" privileges.</dd>
	</dl>
<p></p>

<h3>Creating User Accounts</h3>

<p>The users who belong to a group that has "User Management" privileges can manually add users to the system by using <em>Create User</em>.</p>
<p>User accounts can also be created by individuals using the 
Registration form available through the public pages of AContent. The 
accounts created via the Registration form are automatically set to user
 group "Regular User". </p>

<h3>User Group</h3>

<p><em>User Group</em> is used to create new user groups and edit existing user groups.</p><br><br><h2>Create/Edit User</h2>

<p>All fields on "Create User" and "Edit User" forms are required. Most 
fields are self-explanatory. When the "Account Status" field is set to 
disabled, the user is not able to login. </p>
<p>User accounts can also be created by individuals using the 
Registration form available through the public pages of Transformable. 
The accounts created via the Registration form are automatically set to 
user group "Regular User". </p><br><br><h2>Change Password</h2>

<p>All fields are required and self-explanatory. Once the new password 
is set successfully, an email notification is sent to the user.</p>
<br><br><h2>User Group</h2>

<p>The User Group section allows administrators to manage user groups. 
User groups define the privileges that are granted to the users who are 
members of a group. Note that "Administrator" and "Regular User" groups 
can not  be deleted. They must exist for proper operation of the system.
 All other groups are optional.</p>

<p>There are three default user groups. Below is a description of the 
default privileges that are granted to each group. The privileges in 
user groups are editable by users who are a member of a group that has 
the "User Management" privilege.
</p><dl>
<dt>Administrator</dt>
<dd>Administrators have privileges to use the Home, manage users, languages and manage their own profile.</dd>
<dt>Regular User</dt>
<dd>Regular users have privileges to use the Home and manage their own profile. </dd>
<dt>Translator</dt>
<dd>Translators have privileges to use the Home, translate Transformable
 terms from English to other languages, and to manage their own profile.
 The languages that can be used in the system are defined by users who 
have "Language Management" privileges.</dd>
</dl>
<p></p><br><br><h2>Create/Edit User Group</h2>

<p>All fields are relatively self-explanatory.</p>

<p>There are six privileges provided by Transformable. Privileges are fixed and not changeable.
	</p><dl>
		<dt>Home</dt>
		<dd>This is where user implements own functions.</dd>
		<dt>User Management</dt>
		<dd>Create, edit, delete users.</dd>
		<dt>Language Management</dt>
		<dd>Create, edit, delete, enable, disable languages.</dd>
		<dt>Translation</dt>
		<dd>Translate all Transformable terms into languages other than English, or edit existing English text.</dd>
		<dt>Profile Management</dt>
		<dd>Edit profile, change password or email.</dd>
	</dl>
<p></p><br><br><h2>Create Lesson</h2>
<p>There are two ways to create a lesson, manually by defining course 
properties, and automatically by importing an existing IMS Content 
Package or IMS Common Cartridge.</p>

<h3>Manual Create Lesson</h3>
<p>Follow the "Create Lesson" link on the Create Lesson screen. Fill out
 the Lesson Properties screen then save. You will be directed into the 
lesson, after which you can add folders and content pages to the lesson.
 </p>
<h3>Import Lesson</h3>
<p>If you have an existing lesson, either created in ATutor, or created 
in another system that generates content packages or common cartridges, 
you can either upload the zipped file, or you can enter the URL to its 
location on the Web to import it. Once imported, use the content editing
 tools to modify the content.</p>

<h3>Hide Lesson</h3>
<p>While developing content it is advisable to select the "Hide lesson 
from other users" checkbox.  Once the lesson is ready for public 
viewing, change the setting in the lesson properties.</p><br><br><h3>Lesson Properties</h3>
<p>While viewing any folder of page in a lesson, click on the Lesson Properties icon (<img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/course_property.png" alt="">) to modify the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Title</strong>: Write a few words to provide a short description of the lesson content.</li>
<li><strong>Category Name</strong>: Select from the available content 
categories, the one that best categorizes your lesson. If the category 
you need is not present, choose Uncategorized, or suggest a new category
 to the system's administrator.</li>
<li><strong>Primary Language</strong>: Choose from the available 
languages, the one your lesson is written in. Available languages are 
based on the languages installed on the system. To have additional 
languages installed, talk to your system administrator.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: This a longer description of the lesson, expanding on the description in the title.</li>
<li><strong>Optional Copyright Notice</strong>: Write a copyright notice to appear at the bottom of each page in the lesson.</li>
<li><strong>Hide Lesson</strong>: Select this checkbox if you want to 
prevent others from searching or viewing the lesson. This might be 
enabled while a lesson is being created, then disabled when a lesson is 
ready for distribution.</li>
</ul><br><br>[ TR_HELP_TESTS_SURVEYS ]<br><br>[ TR_HELP_CREATE_TEST ]<br><br>[ TR_HELP_CREATE_TEST ]<br><br><h3>Add Question to a Test</h3>
<p>After selecting a test from the main Test &amp; Survey screen and 
pressing the Questions button to list the questions associated with that
 test, click on the Add Questions tab above to open the Question Bank. 
Either choose a category of questions to add to the test, or choose 
individual questions, then press <strong>Add to Test/Survey</strong> to 
add the questions. You will be redirected back to the question list for 
that test, at which time you must assign mark values to each question 
(unless you are creating a survey in which case questions have no mark 
value).</p><br><br>[ TR_HELP_QUESTION_DB ]<br><br><h3>Question Categories</h3>

<p>Before creating questions it may be helpful to create a number of 
categories into which questions can be grouped. Categories might be as 
simple as "questions for test 1" so when the questions are to be added 
to the test, you may choose the category to have all the question added,
 instead of choosing questions one by one. Categories might also be used
 to define difficulty level, or perhaps topic area. Categories can 
define any type of grouping for questions.</p><br><br><h2>Create and Edit Content</h2>
<p>There are many ways content might be assembled into a lesson. 
Generally, content is created by adding folders to contain the content, 
and adding pages to folders on which the content is displayed. There are
 a variety of tools available to add folders and pages to a lesson. 
These tools are described below. The tools that appear at any given 
time, depend on context.</p>

<h3>Editor Icons</h3>
<ul>
<li><img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/download.html" alt=""> Follow the <strong>Export Content</strong>
 icon to generate an IMS Content Package of the current page. Note, to 
export an entire lesson, use the export tools next to a lesson listing 
on your AContent home page, as either a content package or a common 
cartridge. </li>

<li><img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/medit.gif" alt=""> Follow the <strong>Edit This Page</strong> icon to open the content editor for editing the page you are viewing.</li>

<li><img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/addstruct.gif" alt=""> Follow the <strong>Add Structure</strong>
 icon to add a learning object structure to a lesson. Structures include
 such things as a goals page, a lesson overview, an assessment, or an 
activity for example. Some pages within a lesson structure are mandatory
 and cannot be deleted, while others are optional.</li>


<li><img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/add_sibling_folder.gif" alt=""> Follow the <strong>Add Sibling Folder</strong> icon to add a folder at the same level in the content you are current located.</li>

<li><img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/add_sub_folder.gif" alt=""> Follow the <strong>Add Sub Folder</strong> icon to add a sub folder to a folder you currently have open.</li>

<li><img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/add_sibling_page.gif" alt=""> Follow the <strong>Add Sibling Page</strong> icon to add a content page at the same level in the content you are currently located.</li>

<li><img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/add_sub_page.gif" alt=""> Follow the <strong>Add Sub Page</strong> icon while a folder is open, to add a content page into the folder.</li>

<li><img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/page_delete.gif" alt=""> Follow the <strong>Delete This Page</strong>
 icon while viewing a folder or a content page, to delete it. If you 
delete a folder, all of the pages and folders it contains will also be 
deleted.</li>

<li><img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/course_property.png" alt=""> Follow the <strong>Lesson Properties</strong>
 icon to modify various characteristics of the lesson being viewed 
including its title, category, language, description, copyright notice, 
and whether it is hidden or viewable by others.</li>

<li><img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/arrange_content.gif" alt=""> Follow the <strong>Arrange Content</strong> icon to move folders and pages around within a lesson. </li>

<li><img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/delete.gif" alt=""> Follow the <strong>Delete This Lesson</strong> icon to completely remove the lesson and all its content from the system. </li>

<li><img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/exit.png" alt=""> Follow the <strong>Exit Lesson</strong> icon to leave the lesson area and return to your AContent home page. </li>

</ul>

<h3>The Content Editor</h3>
<p>The Content Editor is use the create content for a lesson. It include
 a number of tabs across the top, and a number of tools for working with
 your content.</p>

<h4> Editor Tabs</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content</strong>:  This is where most content development 
will occur. To create a content page, enter a title, choose the format, 
and add some content to the body area.
	<ul><span>Formatting</span>
	<li>Plain Text: Simply type into the body area. Text is displayed without any formatting </li>
	<li>HTML:  When selected, the visual editor is displayed in the body 
area. Type or paste your text into the visual editor, then use the 
various tools to format the text with headings, colour, layout, and 
other formatting features. Note the first button in the visual editor is
 used to toggle between simple and advanced modes. </li>
	<li>Web Link: This option allows you to enter a URL to an external Web page, and have is display as part of the lesson content. </li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Theme:</strong> When enabled by the AContent system 
administrator, a Theme can be selected to apply a graphic design to the 
content. When an author edits the content, by using the <strong>Theme</strong>
 tab in the content editor, he/she can select and apply graphic elements
 to a page. Such elements are implemented as CSS rules, setting, for 
instance, font-size, font-family, foreground and background colors, 
borders, italic and/or bold style, text alignment and so on, to be added
 to the page cascading over the default graphic design provided by the 
LCMS. A Theme can be applied to a single content page or to an entire 
lesson.</li>

<li><strong>Template:</strong> When enabled by the AContent system administrator, authors can use the <strong>Template</strong>
 tab to format the organization of content on a page. Page templates are
 much like predefined page organizations in word processing 
applications. The author can select the page organization from a set of 
predefined templates, then add or edit content in and around the chosen 
page organizations. Each page template is an HTML fragment, structured 
in conformance with HTML standards.</li>

<li><strong>Meta-data:</strong> Associate  keywords with the content 
page to make it easy to find when searched. Duplicate key words from the
 content to raise the ranking of the page when those keywords are 
searched, enter synonyms of words in the content, or enter words that 
otherwise describe  aspects of the content on that page such as grade 
level, language, or perhaps audience.</li>

<li><strong>Adapted Content</strong>: To accommodate a diverse 
population of learners, authors can include adaptations of their 
original content to make it more accessible to a broad range of people. 
For example, include a text or audio equivalent of an image or other 
visual content to make the content more accessible to blind or low 
vision learners. Add a sign language alternative for text or audio 
content to better accommodate deaf learners. Or, include an audio 
alternative for text to accommodate people with learning of reading 
disabilities.<br><br>

When the Adapted Content tab is opened, it scans through the content of 
the page being edited and identifies any associated resource files and 
lists them as <strong>Original Resources</strong>.  First select the 
appropriate checkbox to define the original resource type, either 
auditory, textual, or visual. Then click on the <strong>Add</strong> 
buttons in the Alternatives columns, and select files from the File 
Manager to add as an alternative for the original resource. Upload the 
files if necessary, and click <strong>Use As Alternative</strong> to associate it as an equivalent for the original resource.</li> 

<li><strong>Tests:</strong> Choose from the available tests you've either imported or created, to associate them with the content page. </li>

</ul>

<h3>Content Editor Tools</h3>
<ul>
<li><img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/preview.png" alt="">Use the Preview tool to open the content you are currently editing to view it before saving.</li>
<li><img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/achecker.png" alt=""> Opening the 
Accessibility tool will evaluate your content for compliance with 
various international accessibility guidelines using the AChecker Web 
service. Note that there is also a smaller accessibility icon in the 
visual editor that performs the same function. </li>
<li><img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/custom_head.png" alt="">Use the 
Scripts/CSS tool to add HTML content that would normally appear in the 
head area of an HTML document. This can include things like Javascript, 
 styles, a reference to a stylesheet, or perhaps HTML meta-data.</li>
<li><img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/paste.png" alt="">Use the Paste 
tool to upload HTML files that you have created in an external HTML 
editor. These must be full HTML pages. Note that there is also a <strong>Paste from Word</strong> tool in the visual editor itself that can be used to take DOC files and convert them into ATutor content pages.</li>
<li><img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/file-manager.png" alt="">Use the File tool to open the File Manager. Upload files into the file manager that are linked into your content, then use the <strong>Insert</strong> button beside a file to insert a link to it in your content page.</li>
</ul><br><br><h3>Edit Content Folder</h3>


<p>To create or edit a content folder, click on the edit icon (<img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/medit.html" alt="">) or add folder icon(<img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/add_sibling_folder.gif" alt="">), then simply edit a title for the folder.  Keep folder titles as short as possible.</p><br><br><h3>Arrange Content</h3>

<p>While viewing content in a lesson, click on the Arrange Content icon (<img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/arrange_content.gif" alt="">)
 to move pages and folders around within that lesson. To move an item, 
select the radio button next to it, then use the before icon (<img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/before.gif" alt="">) to move the selected item before another item, use the after icon (<img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/after.gif" alt="">) to move an item after another item, or use the child of icon (<img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/child_of.gif" alt="">) to move an item into a folder.</p><p><br><br></p><h3>Import/Export Content</h3>
<p>All the import and export content tools can be found in one place by following the Import/Export Content icon (<img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/import_export.png" alt="">) while viewing any page or folder in a lesson.</p>

<h3>Export Content</h3>
<ol>
<li>In the Export section in the upper area of the screen select the portion of the lesson the export from the <strong>What to export</strong> menu. By default the entire lesson is exported.</li>
<li>Select the format to export, either an <strong>IMS Content Package</strong>, or an <strong>IMS Common Cartridge</strong>.
 The format you want to export will depend on the formats supported by 
the system you'll be importing the content into. Content packages 
include only the folders and content pages within a lesson. Common 
cartridges include that same content, but will also include tests and 
forum activities if they have been created for the content.</li>
<li>Choose to export the <strong>AccessForAll (AFA)</strong> adapted 
content with either the content package or common cartridge you export. 
AFA content will often include alternative formats for original content 
that gets presented to learners based on their personal preferences set 
in the system the content is imported into. For example, a blind person 
might chose to have text alternatives displayed instead of images, and a
 deaf person might choose to have sign language replace audio content. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Import Content</h3>

<ol>
<li>Use the <strong>Import Into</strong> to select the position within the existing content of a lesson to place the imported package or cartridge.</li>
<li>Choose to import available tests and AFA content by selecting the checkboxes by each. </li>
<li>Upload the zipped package or cartridge to import it. Note, that you 
may choose to import packages or cartridge that do not validate (vary 
from the standard). In some cases this is fine, but be aware that 
importing invalid content can create problems, such as introducing 
damaging files that have been included with content by malicious users, 
or content that is not recorded in the package or cartridge manifest may
 become orphaned when the content is delete, left behind as files no 
longer used but taking up space. </li>
<li>or, type the URL to a package or cartridge to import it directly from its location on the Web.</li>

</ol><br><br><h3>Edit Content Folder/Page</h3>
<p>Click on the delete folder/page icon (<img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/page_delete.gif" alt="">) to remove a folder and all its sub folders and pages. Click "yes" to confirm the deletion. </p><br><br>[ instructor/?p=file_manager.php ]<br><br><h2>Language Management</h2>

	<p>AContent can be displayed in many different languages! Through the Language Manager language packs can be selected and imported.</p>

<h3>Managing Existing Languages</h3>
	<p>Installed languages can be edited, deleted, or exported as an 
AContent language pack for redistribution. When exporting a language, a 
download prompt will appear asking to download a zip file of the 
language pack.</p>
	<p>Note that the English language (language code: eng) cannot be 
deleted. This is the base language pack that ensures AContent runs 
properly. When other languages are installed, users can disable it if 
they don't want AContent to be displayed in English.</p>
	
<h3>Importing Languages</h3>
	<p>Language packs can be imported by retrieving the package and then importing it into AContent.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Visit <a href="http://www.atutor.ca/acontent/translate/index.php" target="_new">AContent Language Packs</a> to download one of the available language packs for your version.</li>
		<li>Use the <code>Browse...</code> button to find the downloaded language pack.</li>
		<li>Use the <code>Import</code> button to import the language.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>You can contribute to the AContent community by exporting a language
 pack from your AContent installation, and attaching it to a message in 
the atutor.ca <a href="http://atutor.ca/forum/4/1.html">Translation Forum</a>. Also see the <a href="http://atutor.ca/atutor/docs/translate.php">Translator Documentation</a> for further details about translating AContent.</p><br><br><h2>Add/Edit Language</h2>

	<p>Adding and Editing the language properties allows users to change the following:

	<p>When "Status" is set to enabled, the language is displayed in the 
selector at the bottom of AContent pages, which allows users to switch 
to this language.</p><br><br><h2>Translation</h2>

	<p>All fields are self-explanatory. Note that the language drop down 
box lists all the languages defined in the current installation of 
AContent, no regardless of the language status (enabled or disabled). If
 you are translating a new language for AContent, first define the 
language using the Language management tool's Add Language feature. If 
you do not have access to the Language management tools, ask your 
AContent administrator to add the language.</p>

<p>You can contribute to the AContent community by exporting a language 
pack from your AContent installation, and attaching it to a message in 
the atutor.ca <a href="http://atutor.ca/forum/4/1.html">Translation Forum</a>. Also see the <a href="http://atutor.ca/atutor/docs/translate.php">Translator Documentation</a> for further details about translating AContent.</p><br><br><h2>Updater</h2>
	<p>The Updater was introduce in Transformable 1.6 to allow 
administrators to update their systems with feature adjustments, 
security fixes, and other Transformable code changes in between 
Transformable releases. The Updater is included as a standard module 
with Transformable 1.6.1+, and installs as an extra module for 1.6.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>The Update List</dt>
	<dd>On the opening screen of the Updater will appear a list of updates 
available for the version of Transformable you are using, along with a 
description of each update.  This list is retrieved from 
update.atutor.ca, as are the updates themselves, so you must be 
connected to the Internet. Updates are retrieved from update.atutor.ca 
by Transformable and applied as necessary. </dd>
	<dt>File Permissions</dt>
	<dd>In most cases you will be asked to temporarily grant write 
permission to the files that need to be updated or replaced, then once 
the update has been applied, you will be asked to change the permissions
 back to read only. It is important that you follow the instructions 
after updates have been applied, otherwise you run the risk of opening a
 security hole. 
	</dd>
	<dt>Types of Updates</dt>
	<dd>Updates come in various forms. Some updates replace code in a file 
with new code. Others replace a file with a new file.  Others may do 
both on multiple files and multiple code changes. Other updates delete 
files that are no longer required.</dd>
	<dt>Required and Non-Required Updates</dt>
	<dd>In most cases you will want to install updates in the order they 
appear in the update list, but not all updates are required updates.  
Some feature updates can be ignored if you do not need the features they
 would add or modify on your system. Other updates will have 
dependencies, requiring the administrator to install earlier updates 
before installing a later one. You will be prompted to install previous 
updates if there are dependencies.</dd>
	<dt>Checks and File Backups</dt>
	<dd>If you have made changes to a file the Updater wishes to change,  
you will be prompted to continue or not. The updater compares your local
 file with the same file in the Transformable code repository, and if 
they differ the prompt will display. In many cases  the Updater can 
apply updates without changing the code you have modified, but if the 
code to be replaced was modified, the update will fail, or if the update
 replaces a file, your changes will be lost. In all cases the updater 
will create a backup of the files that were modified, identified by the 
filename plus the update number added as a suffix. Rename the file to 
its original name to restore that file back to its original state. You 
can list these files by clicking the view messages button next to the 
update listing after the update is installed. After you have confirmed 
that the updates were applied and are working properly, it is safe to 
delete the backup files, though it does not hurt to keep them around. </dd>
	<dt>Private Updates</dt>
	<dd>In some cases private updates can be applied by uploading a update 
file through the upload form below the update list.  Private updates are
 often those used to apply changes that are not being applied to the 
Transformable default source code, or to apply custom features, or to 
share updates between users, etc. When uploading a update, be sure the 
update id, defined in the patch.xml file, is unique . </dd>
</dl><br><br><h2>Creating Update</h2>

<p>If you happen to come across a bug you can fix, or have a new feature
 you would like added to the Transformable public distribution, you can 
use Create Update to put your changes into a form that can be easily 
added to the Transformable public code. Or, if you have a feature you 
are adding to one Transformable installation that you would like to have
 added to another, Create Update is ideal for reproducing your feature 
across installations. If you are creating new features that are not 
going to become part of the Transformable public source code, you can 
build them into a update so they can be reapplied from version to 
version as you upgrade your Transformable system. Creating updates does 
require knowledge of PHP, and of SQL if you plan on creating a update 
that changes the Transformable database. Please refer to the appropriate
 documentation for information on PHP and SQL. </p><p>

</p><dl>
	<dt>Transformable Update ID</dt>
	<dd>The update id you give to your update must be different from all 
updates available for the particular version of Transformable it applies
 to. It is suggested you prefix your updates with a special identifier 
that represents the author or the authoring organization. If for example
 the University of Toronto is creating the update, a update ID might 
look like "uoft_0002."</dd>
	<dt>Transformable Version to Apply</dt>
	<dd>This needs to be the exact version number of the Transformable 
version the update applies to (e.g 1.6). including any minor version 
numbers (e.g 1.6.1.2)  The exact version number can be found on the 
Administrator open screen under "Statistics and Information." In most 
cases when applying a update created for an older version of 
Transformable, the "Transformable version to Apply" will need to be 
adjusted. Or, this can be adjusted manually in the patch.xml file 
included with the source code of the update.
	</dd>
	<dt>Description</dt>
	<dd>This should be a detailed description of what the update does. 
Example might include "fixes problem uploading files to filemanager" for
 a bug fix, or "added a timer function to tests" for an added feature, 
or "removes registration tab" for a feature adjustment, etc. Include 
enough detail so those applying the update understand exactly what it 
will do..</dd>
	<dt>SQL Statement</dt>
	<dd>This optional field can be used to insert SQL commands which modify
 the Transformable database. It might be used to write an SQL statement 
to modify and existing table, such as changing a data type, or a field 
size, or to add or remove an field. It can also be used to insert SQL 
that generates a new table for a new feature created by a update, or it 
can be used to insert data into a table used by a feature created by the
 update. Any SQL can be included in this field. Be careful when running 
SQL, that that SQL is not going to interfere with upgrade SQL. If you 
are changing table structures and those same tables are being altered 
during an upgrade, the upgrade may fail.</dd>
	<dt>Dependant Updates</dt>
	<dd>It is common for later updates to require changes from earlier 
updates before they can be installed. If this is the case for the update
 you are creating, enter the update IDs into the Dependant Update ID 
field. Click on Add Dependent Update if additional dependencies are 
required. Be sure to check the updates on the opening screen of the 
Updater to see if the file you are modifying with your update is  being 
modified by an update.Transformable.ca update. If they are modifying the
 same files, you may need to include the ID numbers for those updates in
 the Dependant Updates for the update your are creating.</dd>
	<dt>Files</dt>	
	<dd>This area is where most Transformable updates are created. Click on <strong>Add File</strong>
  to generate a update block. A update block can include one of four 
actions on the file being modified, as described below. As many update 
blocks as required can be added to a update. </dd>
		<dl>
	<dt>Add File</dt>
	<dd>The <strong>Add</strong> action can be used to add a new file to 
Transformable. This action is often used in conjuction with other update
 blocks that alter or delete files, to add a replacement file for one 
deleted, or to perhaps add a required or include file needed by a 
modified section in the file being changed. In the <strong>File Name</strong> field enter the file name to be assigned to the file when it is installed. In the <strong>Directory</strong> field enter the <i>relative path</i> from the Transformable root directory in which the modified file is or will exist. Select  from <strong>Upload File</strong>
 using the Browse button to locate the file in your local computer's 
file system. Note that the upload file can have any name. It will be 
renamed to the file name listed in the File Name field when it is 
installed.</dd>
	<dt>Alter File</dt>
	<dd>This option is used when you wish to make changes to a piece of code within an existing source code file. In the <strong>File Name</strong> field enter the name of the file in the Transformable source code that will be altered. In the <strong>Directory</strong>
 field enter the relative path to the directory in which the to be alter
 file exists, relative to the Transformable root directory. In the <strong>Code To Replace From</strong> field copy the code from the original file the will be replaced, or appended to, and in the <strong>Code To Replace To</strong> field enter to code that will replace the code above in the <i>From</i>
 field. Or, if you are adding code instead of replacing code, include 
the code from the field above so it gets added back if you are only 
using that code as a way of identifying a location in the file where new
 code is being added.</dd>
	<dt>Delete File</dt>
	<dd>This option will remove files from Transformable. In the <strong>File Name</strong>  field enter the name of the file to be deleted. In the <strong>Directory</strong>
 field enter the path to the directory in which the to be delete file 
exists, relative to the root directory of the Transformable 
installation. </dd>
	<dt>Overwrite File</dt>
	<dd>This option is used to replace an existing file in Transformable with a new one. In the <strong>File Name</strong>  field enter the name of the file to be replaced. In the <strong>Directory</strong>
 field enter the path to the directory in which the to be replaced file 
exists, relative to the root directory of the Transformable 
installation. In the <strong>Upload File</strong> field use the Browse 
button to choose a file from your local computer to replace the 
specified file. The upload file may be named anything. It will be 
renamed to the file it is replacing when the update is installed.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dt>Create Update</dt>
	<dd>Click on this button to build the update into a downloadable zip 
file. This zip file can then be uploaded in the Upload field on the main
 Updater screen to apply a update to a system.</dd>
	<dt>Save Update</dt>
	<dd>Click on this button to save the developing update to the 
Transformable database for future reference. Though it is not required, 
you should save a copy of the update in this way, so it can be retrieved
 and edited if necessary. Or, if a update takes more than a single 
sitting to build, you can save it, then retrieve it later to continue.</dd>
	<dt>Cancel</dt>
	<dd>Press this button to ignore the latest changes to the update, and return to My Own Updates Screen.</dd>

<h2>Template Editor</h2>
<p>The Template Editor allows administrators to create, edit and manage 
AContent templates. Templates are managed through the four tabs 
described below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create Template</strong>: All new templates are started here, then advance to one of the template editors described below. </li>
<li><strong>Themes</strong>: review and customize existing theme templates and styles.</li>
<li><strong>Structures</strong>: review and modify existing content structures.</li>
<li><strong>Pages</strong>: review and tailor layouts for presenting page content.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Creating a New Template</h3>
<p>To create a new template, select the Create Template tab, then enter 
at least the required information to setup the properties for your new 
template. The required fields are decribed below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Template Name</strong>:  A descriptive name for the theme, which appears with its thumbnail. Keep it short. </li>
<li><strong>Template Type</strong>:   Select  either Theme, Page, or Structure</li>
<li><strong>Maintainer Name</strong>:  Who is maintaining the theme?</li>
<li><strong>Release Version</strong>:   Set this value to a number 
greater than or equal to 1.0 to make the template available to use while
 authoring content. Set to 0.9 or less to keep the template hidden while
 it is being developed.</li>
<li><strong>Release State</strong>: Words like Dev, Beta, Stable, Mature to describe the development state.</li>
</ul>
<p>Click the Create button to save the properties for the new template 
and move on to the respective template editor to create the rest of the 
template. See the handbook page while using each editor for more about 
creating and maintaining templates.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Structure Template Editor</h2>
<p>Use the Structure Template Editor to create and modify standard 
content units, made up of things like a syllabus, outline, references, 
content, and a quiz, for instance. </p>
<p>The Structure Template Editor has a toolbar across the top, a text 
window to the left where the template XML file is generated, and the 
interactive treeview to the right. Review the default structures that 
come with AContent, to understand how content units are assembled. And, 
see the toolbar buttons described below.</p> 

<h3>Toolbar</h3>
<p>As you click and select nodes in the treeview,  the toolbar buttons will change according to the selected node.</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/add_sub_folder.gif" alt=""> Inserts a sub folder under the currently selected node. Only available for structure or folder nodes.</li>
<li><img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/add_sub_page.gif" alt=""> Inserts a page under the currently selected node. Only available for structure and folder nodes.</li>
<li><img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/tree_page_templates.gif" alt=""> Inserts a pagetemplates node under the currently selected page. </li>
<li><img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/tree_page_template.gif" alt=""> Inserts a page template node under the currently selected pagetemplates node.</li>
<li><img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/tree_tests.gif" alt=""> Inserts a tests node under the currently selected page.</li>
<li><img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/tree_test.gif" alt=""> Inserts a test node under the currently tests node.</li>
<li><img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/tree_forum.gif" alt=""> Inserts a forum under the currently selected page.</li>
<li>Use the Name field to set the name of the currently selected node. 
Names can be set for structure, folder, page, test, page template, and 
forum nodes.</li>
<li>Use the Min and Max fields to set the minimum and maximum numbers 
for the currently selected node. Only available for structure, folder, 
page, test, page template and forum nodes.</li>
<li><img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/x.gif" alt=""> Delete the currently selected node. Deleting the top structure element will delete the whole template.</li>
<li><img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/move_up.png" alt=""><img src="ac_handbook_admin_files/move_down.png" alt=""> Move the currently selected node up or down .</li>
</ul>
<p>You can easily reorder treeview nodes by dragging and dropping them 
within a suitable parent node. For example, you can only move a Test 
node under a Page node. If you know what you are doing, you can also 
modify the XML code in the text window and the treeview will auto update
 to reflect your changes.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Theme Template Editor</h2>
<p>The Theme Template Editor allows you create and customize templates 
that control the look and feel of a page, a lesson, or a course. On the 
left is the editor, either Basic, editing through the context sensitive 
form, or Advanced, editing the CSS directly.</p>
<p>To the right is the preview panel to display a live update of the 
template. In basic mode you can select the elements in the preview panel
 on the right, to have the CSS properties of the selected element 
displayed in the editor panel on the left. You can set values for most 
basic CSS properties such as text alignment, font, background and 
border. More complex CSS may not be supported.</p>

<p>If there is a style you can not create with the editor, you may edit the CSS directly to add your own custom styles.</p>
<p>The <strong>Associated Images</strong> panels below the editor is 
where you upload and manage the images associated with the theme. See 
how associated images are referenced by viewing the CSS of other theme 
templates.</p>
<p>The <strong>Screenshot</strong> area allows you to either automatically generate a thumbnail, or upload one to represent the theme.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Page Template Editor</h2>
<p>The Page Template Editor allows you to create and customize units 
that layout the content of a page. Page templates can be as simple or 
complex as you like. One page template can be used as a full page of 
content, or several page templates can be strung together to create a 
page.</p>

<p>There are two modes: Basic and Advanced. </p>
<p>In <strong>Basic mode</strong> you have a WYSIWYG editor you can use 
to insert some basic page elements such as paragraphs, lists, boxes, 
tables, and images using the buttons in the toolbar. You can also modify
 text alignment, change text format, and font etc. </p>
<p>In <strong>Advanced mode</strong> you can edit the HTML code 
directly. View the HTML of other page templates for examples of the 
element included in a page template. </p>
<p>At the bottom is the Screenshot panel where you can quickly generate a
 screenshot automatically, or upload one you have custom created. </p>
