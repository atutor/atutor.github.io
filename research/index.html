<h2>Research in E-learning</h2>
<h3>ATutor's Origin in LMS Research</h3>
<p>ATutor came about after two studies in 1999 and 2000 that looked at the accessibility of popular Learning Managment Systems (LMS) to people with disabilities. The first of these studies was a technical audit which measured the accessibility of these systems against the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 1.0). The second was a user study that involved people with various types of disabilities participating in a 6 week online course in which each weekly unit was presented in a different LMS.  The links below lead to the details of theses studies.
