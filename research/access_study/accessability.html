    Abstract</b></h2>
  <p><i>Providing educational opportunities within online environments, while 
    beneficial, also has the potential to exclude a significant portion of the

    from accessing online learning environments due to problems in the design 
    of the technology itself, as well as with the pedagogy directing the use of 
    this technology.  By taking into account both technical and pedagogical accessibility 
    considerations, people with physical and/or learning disabilities are encouraged 
    to become producers of information, and not just passive consumers.  Operating 
    an accessible, inclusive electronic classroom ensures students with disabilities 
    can participate with parity in global educational exchange.  </i></p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The role of technology in lifelong learning and Continuing Education (CE) 
    is expanding exponentially. Lifelong learning is now accepted as a basic tenet 
    of living in the (post)modern world, where education as a product of schooling 
    has given way to education as process: continual, over time. Learning is no 
    longer seen as an activity undertaken in youth, as preparation for adult life; 
    rather, it is seen as integral to living. Continuing Education--the idea of 
    lifelong learning--has permeated the larger fabric of culture, especially 
    given the &quot;any time, any place&quot; capabilities of networked learning 
    environments utilizing Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). However, 
    providing educational opportunities within online environments, while beneficial, 
    also has the potential to exclude a significant portion of the population. 
    Those that are learning and/or physically disabled may be prevented from accessing 
    online learning environments due to problems in the design of the technology 
    itself, as well as with the pedagogy directing the use of this technology.</p>
  <p>The widespread use of ICT in education has resulted in &quot;new learning 
    technologies and the internet . . . providing educational possibilities that 
    did not exist before. What makes these developments troubling . . . is the 
    absence, in many cases, of planning for access by students with disabilities. 
    The implications of this omission are obvious. New technological barriers 
    are slowly being erected where others have fallen&quot; [1]. The World Wide 
    Web Consortium's (W3C) Website Accessibility Initiative (WAI) provides guidelines 
    for developing and designing accessible online media to prevent such &quot;digital 
    divides&quot; from growing disproportionately to the continued use of educational 
    ICT. However, &quot;The digital divide will continue to expand if this issue 
    [accessibility] is not addressed in our research, education and outreach. 
    As the rapid development of new web applications continues, it is necessary 
    to ensure that new barriers are not erected to effective communication and 
    commerce&quot; [2].&quot;Several studies on attrition in distance education, 
    particularly web-based courses have noted that difficulty with accessing web-based 
    materials is a major obstacle in distance education&quot; [3], and with the 
    growing reliance on networked technologies and online learning components 
    in all facets of education--not just distance learning--it is increasingly 
    important to ensure that accessibility standards are built into the products 
    used to serve learning material on the web.</p>
  <p>The Canadian government has recently implemented policy to ensure that legislation 
    providing access to persons with disabilities is applied to digital media, 
    following the WAI guidelines [4]. Recent legislation in the United States 
    has also ensured that all online information is accessible to persons with 
    disabilities or who rely on adaptive and assistive technologies [5]. It is 
    expected that voluntary compliance on the part of all online education providers 
    will happen as a matter of course and in keeping with the evolving standards 
    of the WWW; &quot;However, even though web accessibility guidelines exist, 
    some administrators consider campus-wide initiatives to standardize the creation 
    of web materials a costly time-consuming task that is difficult to enforce&quot; 
    [3]. Since &quot;post-secondary institutions are reluctant to allocate funding 
    for the training and resources needed to assist educators in modifying and 
    creating acceptable web materials&quot; [3], it is imperative to seek ways 
    to encourage the accessible design of web materials from their first iteration.</p>
  <p>From the point of view of students taking a web course, it is necessary for 
    online course designers to consider accessibility from both technical and 
    pedagogical standpoints. With respect to technical issues, these are concerned 
    with the accessibility of various online elements when adaptive technology 
    is being used in this access. The pedagogical issues are closely related, 
    in that good pedagogy takes the technical access considerations into account 
    when creating online curricula. In addition, it is also imperative to provide 
    adequate and comprehensive instructions for the use of the actual courseware 
    itself, as well as dedicated institutional support for faculty using ICT. 
    Accessibility should be considered from both points of view, and that these 
    divergent issues--the technical and the pedagogical--are inherently linked. 
  </p>
  <p><a href="#top">[ top ]</a> <b><a name="design"></a></b></p>
  <h2><b>Recommendations for Inclusive Design</b></h2>
  <p>Complexities in page layouts, inconsistencies in item labelling, a lack of 
    instructions for task completion and the absence of consistent and clear functions 
    related to items within courseware platforms are the most major technical 
    obstacles to accessibility. Courseware developers need to ensure their platforms 
    conform to the current WAI guidelines in order to ensure full accessibility 
    of information. In addition, there needs to be consideration of the provision 
    of redundant information display to aid those who are learning disabled. Additionally, 
    problems with courseware platforms and adaptive or assistive technology--OS/default 
    settings (e.g. mail program)--need to be addressed and tested or at least 
    acknowledged in order to lessen the deleterious effects of any incompatibilities 
    that may arise.</p>
  <p>Online learning &quot;content needs to become more informative (what we communicate, 
    not how we communicate it), more independent of the delivery medium (an information 
    medium--not a visual medium), richer and more multi-modal (address different 
    learning styles and needs). Once these challenges are met we will have a technology 
    that is more usable by all&quot; [6]. Separating the media used to access 
    educational material from the content puts the emphasis on the content as 
    flexible and malleable to fit a variety of presentation media (text, audio, 
    etc.).New mark-up languages (XML, XSL, CSS, DOM, XUL, Java) &quot;separate 
    content and structure from presentation&quot; and &quot;separate function 
    from input [and output] method&quot; [6]. This separation allows people who 
    need alternative or redundant output devices to access media that otherwise 
    may be inaccessible to them, and future courseware applications should strive 
    to include the option of coding in these modalities. &quot;The transformative 
    power of computers makes most of this information available for the first 
    time to many people with disabilities&quot; because digital media can be adapted 
    to multiple outputs: &quot;Innovative display and control alternatives can 
    be offered that afford access to users with a wide range of skills and needs. 
    The interactive mechanisms [of digital media] allow learners to customize 
    the presentation of the learning materials (the pacing, the order, the modality, 
    etc.) while retaining a rich, engaging learning experience&quot; [6] see also<b> 
    </b>[7]. Technical considerations aside, the most important obstacle to accessibility 
    is effective pedagogical deployment of the technology use in educational contexts.</p>
  <p>Internet experience (or lack thereof) and experience with assistive technology 
    can vastly affect the success or failure of any online learning venture. Both 
    pedagogical and technical considerations can make or break the successful 
    use of online learning technologies. Pedagogically, course instructors using 
    any courseware platform or considering using online learning networks must 
    be aware of accessibility issues and how the platform being used might fail 
    to meet these standards. Instructors must ensure that information is appropriately 
    displayed (insofar as this relates to the ability of the instructor to manipulate 
    the courseware display of information) and that any learning disabilities 
    that may require special consideration (with respect to information display, 
    redundancy, etc.) are taken into consideration in the design phase of the 
    online course creation.</p>
  <p>Technical faults can be worked around, although this can be costly, time 
    consuming, and frustrating for all concerned. Given these considerations, 
    the most important issue is the role effective pedagogy must play in shaping 
    the use of the technology.&nbsp;With respect to technical and pedagogical 
    considerations and accessible online media, it is imperative that inclusive 
    pedagogical practices take a more active role in directing the development 
    of technology, rather than reacting to it successive innovations. The need 
    for built-in accessibility in the tools being used to facilitate online learning 
    must be prioritized. The pedagogy needs to direct the development of technology, 
    particularly as this relates to the need to ensure accessibility.</p>
  <p>At issue here is the role of timely information, adequate support and training 
    for people just learning digital literacy skills. The concept of digital literacy 
    includes not only the skill to use information technologies (broadly defined 
    as any technology that mediates the use of information), but also the requisite 
    skills to decode, contextualize, and critically evaluate this information 
    (see [8]; [9]; [10]; [11]; [12]). An important addition to this aspect of 
    literacy has been the concept of universal design, or accessibility, with 
    respect to physically and/or learning disabled persons. With 20% of the population--54 
    million people in the US alone [2]--suffering from some sort of physical or 
    learning disability, and with this percentage increasing as the population 
    ages, it is essential&nbsp;to factor in accessibility guidelines from the 
    first iteration of online learning development. This applies equally to any 
    cause of inaccessibility--technical or pedagogical--and means being aware 
    of concepts such as universal design and the potential limitations of any 
    use of ICT in education.</p>
  <p><a href="#top">[ top ]</a> <b><a name="enabling"></a></b></p>
  <h2><b>Enabling Learning Through Technology</b></h2>
  <p>Just as buildings are built with accessibility factored into their architecture 
    from the ground up, so too must WWW and Internet architecture factor in accessibility 
    initiatives from the outset to ensure equitable access to online resources. 
    By taking into account both technical and pedagogical accessibility considerations, 
    people with physical and/or learning disabilities are encouraged to become 
    producers of information, and not just passive consumers. By operating an 
    accessible, inclusive electronic classroom, students with disabilities can 
    participate with parity in global educational exchange, and &quot;positive 
    feedback from their peers can encourage students with learning [and physical] 
    disabilities to become even more active&quot; in the educational process [13]. 
    What is clear from the study is that the development of the incidental skills 
    that accrue with using technologically mediated learning environments result 
    in &quot;improved self-confidence and self-esteem, enhanced social skills 
    and computer proficiency, as well as greater motivation for continued skill 
    development&quot; [13].Ensuring accessibility in course designs that utilize 
    online technologies will ensure that the wider population benefits from these 
    programs:&nbsp;&quot;For people without disabilities, technology makes things 
    convenient; for people with disabilities, it makes things possible&quot; [6].The 
    very design of accessible online programs offers disabled persons an avenue 
    to pursue CE programs where none might have existed before.</p>
  <p>While it is true that&nbsp;&quot;The extent to which the educational process 
    will be altered by technology undoubtedly will reflect the impact of the technology 
    on society as a whole&quot; [14], this is only true to the extent that this 
    technology is accessible to all. Inclusive electronic learning environments&nbsp;directly 
    benefit online learning by providing access to lifelong learning programs 
    to those at risk of being left out of these programs in the first place. In 
    order for these programs to be successful and truly inclusive, it is &quot;important 
    that post-secondary institutions provide the necessary training, resources, 
    and tools to develop accessible web materials&quot; [3]. This applies equally 
    to those developing online learning structures and those who learn with and 
    through them. Adequate training in digital literacy skills (including online 
    learning technologies and adaptive and assistive technologies) is essential 
    if inclusive electronic classrooms are to become an effective part of educational 
    reality. The cross-hatching of pedagogy- and technology-based considerations 
    reflects the fact that&nbsp;&quot;Information is so broadly based and the 
    acquisition of knowledge so complex that new ways of teaching and learning 
    are essential if students of such great diversity are to be truly engaged 
    in the learning process&quot; [15]. This learning diversity can be reflected 
    in the multi-modal display of information that makes it more accessible. By 
    making information more accessible for all, everyone benefits [7].</p>
  <p>Making information available outside the physical constraints of the traditional 
    classroom, and opening this classroom up to a fluid negotiation of identity, 
    results in a more open, flexible learning environment that is responsive to 
    multiple users who may be restricted (either temporarily or permanently) by 
    mobility impairment. &quot;The primary reason for insisting on interactive 
    communication outside the physical classroom itself--at least as a possibility--is 
    because of the capacity of electronic technology to create an open information 
    system and a more open, flexible model of student-teacher interaction&quot; 
    [16], provided accessibility is built into the electronic classroom. This 
    pedagogical flexibility is reflected in the fact that &quot;what is of most 
    significance to the future of education, especially for students with disabilities, 
    is the unequalled flexibility and transformability of digital media&quot; 
    [7]. Digital media &quot;remain malleable, transformable from one thing to 
    another, more like raw clay than fired pottery&quot; [7].</p>
  <p>Developing digital literacies means engaging with the larger technologically 
    mediated world and taking responsibility for learning from this vast and inchoate 
    matrix of information that comprises the WWW [9]. The ability to use online 
    media in order to access educational programs ensures a technological &quot;self-efficacy&quot; 
    [11]; (see also&nbsp;[17] ; [10]). This technological self-efficacy renders 
    the technology transparent enough to enable learning through network technologies.</p>
  <p><a href="#top">[ top ]</a> <b><a name="conclusion"></a></b></p>
  <h2><b>Conclusion: Context</b></h2>
  <p>Recontextualizing and reconceptualizing teaching and learning within networked 
    paradigms creates new pedagogies, or &quot;digital pedagogies&quot; that acknowledge 
    the realities of living and working in a digitally networked world (Privateer 
    1999). These &quot;’digital pedagogies,’ [are] new ways of educating more 
    consistent with the nature of contemporary technologies than with prior management 
    models&quot; (Privateer 1999, p.61), and will result in an emphasis on shifting 
    the goals of education from &quot;the mastery of content (content will be 
    available everywhere, anytime, electronically) [to] the mastery of learning. 
    At commencement, we will graduate students who are ‘expert learners’&quot; 
    [7]. The evolution towards learning as process is replacing the old product-centered 
    model, and will result in changing conceptions of the role of learning itself. 
    In order to be effective and accessible, these new digital pedagogies must 
    take issues of access and digital literacy into account when designing programs 
    that use any sophisticated digital media. These programs must also acknowledge 
    other barriers to pursuing education, including &quot;cultural, social, familial, 
    personal, or financial barriers&quot; [18]. Taking into account the larger 
    social fabric in which education participates means recognizing that&nbsp;&quot;it 
    is environmental factors and accessibility features of computer and information 
    technologies that form either facilitators or barriers to students with disabilities&quot; 
    [1]. These environmental factors include the extent to which users of online 
    learning networks have significant training or experience in the use of all 
    technologies of information access, and the extent to which these networks 
    offer inclusive, accessible educational space.</p>
  <p>Fichten et al (1999) show that it is necessary to develop a cultural or environmental 
    approach to providing accessible learning environments: &quot;Many policies 
    reflect the view that problems originate from within the individual rather 
    than arising from the environment. The approach taken, therefore, is to try 
    to remediate or to provide accommodation for individual impairments rather 
    than to locate the problem in the environment and the prevailing social structure. 
    . . . Unless there is a shift away from the current person-centered ideology 
    toward a broader, more systemic view that students with disabilities will 
    continue to be denied full access to postsecondary education because computer 
    and information technologies will continue to be designed and built with inaccessible 
    features. Substantial effort must be undertaken to educate manufacturers of 
    computer technologies as well as to formulate and implement strong federal 
    legislation, similar to that now in effect in the United States regarding 
    technology, to render technologies accessible&quot; [1]. This reflects the 
    view that building accessible online media will benefit all (see [7].&nbsp;By 
    building in &quot;electronic curbcuts&quot; from the ground up, online education 
    programs ensure they meet the principles of universal design and so are not 
    exclusionary.</p>
  <p>This environmental shift towards a digital pedagogy will open up the educational 
    process for all, provided this shift includes an emphasis on accessibility. 
    Changing conceptions of education (towards lifelong learning) and in learning 
    styles (with the inclusion of multiple modalities enabled through digital 
    technology and pedagogy) will result in a more positive and inclusive social 
    structure as a whole. &quot;In addition, the more differentiated use of media 
    for instruction reveals that individuals who are defined as ‘learning disabled’ 
    within print-based learning environments are not the same individuals who 
    are defined as ‘learning disabled’ within video- or audio-based learning environments. 
    Such revelations splinter the old categorical divisions between ‘disability’ 
    and ‘ability’ and create new descriptors that explicitly recognize the interaction 
    between student and environment in the definition of strengths&quot; [7]. 
    Within a reconceptualization of education as process enabled through accessible 
    media and by digital pedagogies, all types of learners can participate equally, 
    and are acknowledged as equal partners in education.</p>
  <p>Access<i>Ability</i> means providing an inclusive, accessible environment 
    for learning that might otherwise be closed to people with physical and/ or 
    learning disabilities. Enabling technology thus has two distinct meanings. 
    he first is that technology is enabling to those with disabilities (accessible 
    technology).The second is the fact that technology enables different conceptions 
    of teaching and learning: it mobilizes or is mobilized to construct digital 
    pedagogies. Information and communication technologies can allow access to 
    educational opportunities for a wider audience, especially with asynchronous 
    online delivery of curricular materials. But rather than just using online 
    media to deliver course materials and to perhaps facilitate communication 
    between students and instructors, these media have the potential to radically 
    alter the very pedagogy that underlies the provision of distance education. 
    &quot;’Accessibility is the challenge that will finally push the Web to become 
    the ubiquitous tool for interactive knowledge sharing it was meant to be. 
    Creating an environment which is welcoming to billions of users with widely 
    varying motivations, capabilities and needs is not a fringe goal but <u>the</u> 
    critical goal’&quot; [6].The effect of using technology in lifelong learning 
    programs is an enhanced understanding of the ground of these media themselves; 
    that is, an understanding of how these media operate with and in the larger 
    context of a learning culture. Technical considerations notwithstanding, the 
    most important element of ensuring and designing accessible media is a sound 
    pedagogy driving the technology itself.</p>
