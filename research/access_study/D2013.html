<h1>Inclusion in an Electronic Classroom</h1>



<h2 >Disability Group: BLIND</h2>


<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>ID 2013</P>



</B><P>Summary of problems observed in each of the various protocols and the corresponding sources of these problems for participant 2013.</P>



<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Course Inf.</P>

<P>Item 1 (Create an account).</P>



<OL>



</B><LI>Instructions were needed to get through this item. Participant tried to log in first. Instructions were needed to get past login to create the account.</LI>

<LI>Participant asked questions about the password provided (Is that one &quot;D&quot; or 2?; Do you need my full name here?; Is there a particular password that I should use?). Participant had to be reminded that only the boxes with a star besides it was required information and that all others could be skipped.</LI>

<LI>Participant tried to enter the password but the program did not accept it. The computer responded with a message saying that the password being entered contained spaces. The participant tried a number of times to re-enter the password but the error message appeared each time. Intervention was required by the researcher to successfully create an account.</LI></OL>





<B><P>Summary:</P>





<UL>

</B><LI>Participant needed instructions to get through this item. It was not self-evident that she first needed to create an account before logging in. Participant did not listen carefully to instructions indicating that only boxes with asterisk were required. She had to be reminded that she had skipped over certain asterisked information boxes where information was required. Participant unknowingly enters spaces when typing in her password. Begins to get frustrated after the computer repeatedly comes up with the same error message.</LI></UL>



<B>

<P>Item 11 (Read any messages in the Chat Room) and Item 12 (Post a message to the Chat Room).</P>



<OL>



</B><LI>There were no messages to read. So the participant was encouraged to try posting something first and then read what was posted later (reversed the sequence of items).</LI>

<LI>Participant was able to open the Chat but once she was in there she was only able to access two edit boxes: One that was called &quot;Location&quot; which was not obvious as to what its function might be, and the other had no title. The participant kept tabbing between the two boxes but she was unaware that there were indeed two boxes (didn’t recognize the untitled box as a second box). </LI>

<LI>With instructions, the participant was able to enter a message but she could not read it. Participant would not be aware (unless she has had a lot of experience with chat rooms) that the message was visible in another field of the screen. Participant was unable to successfully manipulate JAWS to read the posted message even with detailed instructions and descriptions of the set-up of the screen. Hence she was unable to read the message.</LI></OL>





<B><P>Summary: </B><p>


<UL>

<LI>The layout of the screen created problems for the participant. Failure to label the different edit boxes also created confusion. </LI>

<LI>Participant was not aware that the posted message could be read (cursor does not go into posted message box). After the layout of the screen was described and instructions given with regards to how the message can be read, the participant experienced a lot of difficulties manipulating and using JAWS and was unable to complete the task (Item11).</LI></UL>



<B>





<P>Item 13 (Try the Whiteboard which is part of the Chat Room).</P>



</B><P>1. The white-board was not accessible.</P>

<B>



<P>Item 14 (Try the electric blackboard linked from the Student Tools page. Try posting a message or typing a few lines of text).</P>



<OL>



</B><LI>Participant was able to select the electric blackboard without difficulties. But once she was in there, she could only access the &quot;save&quot; and &quot;close&quot; buttons at the bottom of the screen. The edit box in the centre was not accessible. Hence the participant was not aware of its presence. The researcher informed the participant that the edit box necessary for posting the message was present but for unknown reasons currently not accessible.</LI>

<LI>The participant tried to close the electric blackboard so that she can attempt the task once again from a fresh perspective. Instead of closing the EB however, she closed off the browser. As a result she was required to log-in again from the beginning.</LI>

<LI>After logging in again, this participant was still unable to access the edit box in the electric blackboard. The cursor went to the &quot;save&quot; and &quot;close&quot; box but not the edit box.</LI>

<LI>Physical intervention was required to put the cursor into the edit box.</LI></OL>





<B><P>Summary:</P>





<UL>

</B><LI>The edit box was inaccessible for this participant. This inaccessibility can be due to a number of factors: interactions between the software and JAWS; or potentially because the participant was using the wrong JAWS cursor. This is not a particular problem with the software because other participants using JAWS and completely reliant on the keyboard have been able to access the edit box without difficulties.</LI></UL>







<B><P>Item 15 (Submit a file to your drop-box linked from the Student Tools page).</P>



<OL>



</B><LI>Participant had difficulty locating the cursor. Instructions were necessary to locate the cursor. Once the cursor was located, participant had difficulties getting JAWS to read the page.</LI>

<LI>Participant tabbed through the screen in search for an edit box. The edit box was found but once again JAWS failed to read the &quot;browse&quot; button. Unaware of the presence of the browse button, the participant became confused about the task at hand and had to be reminded about the purpose of the tasks and the steps that were necessary to complete the task (You have to upload a file etc.)</LI>

<LI>Hence instructions were required to complete the task.</LI></OL>





<B><P>Summary:</P>





<UL>

</B><LI>The participant experienced difficulties with JAWS for a number of reasons: As a result of her inexperience with JAWS and her problems manipulating the use of the different JAWS cursors; As a result of problems with the adaptive technology (JAWS) and its interactions with the software.</LI>

<LI>Again there were similar problems (as before) with the &quot;browse&quot; button.</LI>

<LI>Participant did not fully grasp or did not formulate in her head the steps necessary for completing the task. This caused confusion. As a result, she had to be instructed step by step how to complete the task.</LI></UL>







<B><P>Item 7 (Enter your student information, linked from the Student Tools page, and create a new password).</P>



<OL>



</B><LI>JAWS did not read the screen automatically.  The participant was having a lot of difficulties developing a map of what the screen looked. The fact that JAWS did not read the screen only aided to exasperate the problem.</LI>

<LI>The researcher provided a description of the page to the participant in an effort to help her form a map of its layout and contents.</LI>

<LI>The participant tried entering the new password but it didn’t work. She needed instructions on entering her new password.</LI></OL>





<B><P>Summary:</P>





<UL>

</B><LI>This participant experienced a lot of difficulties with JAWS. These difficulties were not due exclusively to the inconsistencies with the adaptive technology but also to the participant’s inexperience with JAWS.</LI>

<LI>The participant did not try to form a visual map of the contents even when the researcher described the screen to her. Participant also experienced problems entering her new password. The computer did not accept her new password hence she required instructions for entering it</LI></UL>



<B>

<P>Item 23 (Complete the online Quiz linked from the bottom of the Assignment page).</P>



<OL>



</B><LI>Participant required hints and clarifications to get to the icon for taking the &quot;quiz&quot;.</LI>

<LI>Actually taking the quiz was very problematic. Participant could not get the cursor to work properly. She was able to read the questions by routing JAWS to PC (since JAWS did not read automatically) but was not able to enter the answers into the corresponding edit boxes as she switched back and forth from cursor to cursor. She found it difficult to keep track of her location with the manipulation of the cursors.</LI>

<LI>The researcher and a third party tried to intervene but without success. This item was skipped.</LI></OL>





<B><P>Summary:</B><p>


<UL>

<LI>Participant does not closely listen to the instructions presented.</LI>

<LI>Same or similar problems with JAWS (as a result of the participant’s inexperience and the inherent problems with the adaptive technology itself).</LI>

<LI>Participant had difficulties entering the information (making selection of radio buttons and entering the information into the edit boxes) necessary for the completion of the Quiz. She was able to read the question by switching cursors but when she had to re-route to enter the data she was lost.</LI>

<LI>Based on the lack of success also experienced by the researcher and a third party, it is safe to conclude that JAWS was a main source of the problems experienced here.</LI></UL>







</B>



<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>WEB-CT</B><p>
<B><P>Item 3 (Read the Access Exercise linked from the Home Page).</P>



<OL>



</B><LI>Participant was not sure where she should locate the icon. She did a list link and was able to find something that said &quot;Access Assignment&quot; but not &quot;Access Exercise&quot;. She asked if this was the icon that she needed to go into. </LI>

<LI>The participant was informed of the inconsistency in the labelling of this particular icon and was told that the names were inconsistently used, that is, it was called &quot;access assignment&quot; on the home page but &quot;access exercise once you had selected the &quot;access assignment&quot; icon. </LI>

<LI>Participant required instructions for reading the access exercise. JAWS does not read automatically and continued to read the Home page even after we had left it. </LI></OL>









<B>

<P>Summary:</P>





<UL>

</B><LI>Inconsistency with the terminology used in the software.</LI>

<LI>Interactions between JAWS and the software.</LI></UL>








<B><P>Item 5 (View the Course notes from the beginning to the end, linked from the course Content. Use the navigation buttons in the top frame or use the Contents to navigate the Course Notes).</P>



<OL>



</B><LI>Participant needed instruction for locating the course notes.</LI>

<LI>Once we had got into the Course Content, participant had to be instructed to select &quot;outline&quot;. Participant did not get a global sense of what the exercise was going to be about. The researcher explained the exercise to her again</LI>

<LI>Participant became confused when JAWS read symbols and Java scripts instead of  &quot;alt&quot; text for the navigation buttons in the top frame within the course notes. Participant was confused about the layout of the page so once again, the researcher had to explain and describe it to her. </LI>

<LI>The participant avoided the navigation buttons (in the top frame) for navigating the course notes (no alt text, confusing symbols). Instead she had no other option but to return to the main course note page and then select another course note (so it was a back and forth movement to read all the course notes which was not easily managed and navigated by the participant).</LI></OL>





<B><P>Summary:</B><p>


<UL>

<LI>Navigating within the course notes (from one course note to the other) seemed a bit too cumbersome. The participant could not make use of the navigation buttons and hence had to take the long route to viewing all the course notes.</LI>

<LI>Problems with the navigation menu icons which did not have &quot;alt text&quot;</LI>

<LI>Participant was not motivated to complete the task. She seemed preoccupied with other thoughts.</LI></UL>





<B>

<P>Item 10 (Start the Whiteboard from the Tools page and try out its features). </B><p>
<OL>



<LI>Physical intervention was required to start the whiteboard. After selecting the Whiteboard from the Tools page, the participant was next required to select the &quot;start whiteboard&quot; button. The page had three different buttons: Home, Back and Start Whiteboard. The subject was only able to access the first two. </LI>

<LI>The participant was unable to tab to the third button which was needed to start the whiteboard. Physical Intervention was required at this point to start the whiteboard since the participant was not willing to try manipulating the cursors again</LI>

<LI>When attempting to exit the white-board. A message box verifying that the participant did indeed want to exit  &quot;Exit white-board? &quot; popped on.  The problem here is that JAWS does not read the OK/CANCEL options so that the blind user does not know which button performs what function (is the first button that she tabs to in the popped up window to affirm the exit (OK) or is it to cancel the request to exit (CANCEL)) unless she manipulates the mouse cursor which requires a lot of skill and familiarity with JAWS. Participant had to be told which button was to confirm the exit.</LI></OL>







<B><P>Summary:</B><p>


<UL>

<LI>Start white-board option is not available from the keyboard (without the mouse cursor)</LI>

<LI>Exiting the white-board can be somewhat problematic also. Jaws does not read the &quot;OK&quot;/ "CANCEL&quot; button.</LI></UL>





<P>&nbsp;</P>

















































<P></P>

















































<B><P>Item 11 (Sign into the Chat Room and read a message).    Item 12 (Post a message to the Chat Room).</P>



<OL>



</B><LI>The participant was searching for an option that was called &quot;Chat Room&quot; but instead found one called &quot;Java Chat, which she did not equate to mean the same thing. </LI>

<LI>Once she had selected the Java Chat, she was then unable to access the Rooms. Again there were three main icons on the screen: Home, Back and the Middle group of Icons including (Rm1-4, General Chat for Advocate and Chat for Course). Only the first two were accessible, the middle group of icons containing the icons necessary for chatting was inaccessible from the keyboard. </LI>

<LI>The researcher explained to the participant what the screen looked like and with guidance the participant was able to use the mouse cursor (Route JAWS to PC) to select one of that chat rooms.</LI>

<LI>Once she had got into the Chat room, the layout of the chat created further problems. The participant did not know where the edit box for entering message was located. She needed instructions here. With some guidance, she was able to route JAWS to PC and read the options. Some of it was still confusing however, because the edit box being read was being associated with  &quot;Quit&quot; (since this icon was in the same row and the edit box didn’t have a title already associated with it).</LI>

<LI>The participant was also able to read the message posted with guidance and instruction about where on the screen the posted message was located.</LI></OL>





<B><P>Summary:</P>





<UL>

</B><LI>Inconsistency of terminology created some confusion for the participant.</LI>

<LI>Java Chat is not accessible. (only if use mouse cursor)</LI>

<LI>Layout of the chat room was confusing. Participant could not find the edit box (which was not properly labelled) for entering the message.</LI></UL>





<B>

<P>Item 14 (Submit a file using the Assignment Drop-box, which is linked from the Tools Page).</P>



<OL>



</B><LI>The steps to submitting a file from the assignment drop-box were not very obvious. The subject went into &quot;access exercise&quot; (where she needed to go) only by default and not because it seemed like the right thing to do.</LI>

<LI>After she had gone into Access assignment she went on to choose &quot;submit assignment&quot; but was unable to since she had not yet chosen a file to submit. </LI>

<LI>Participant then had difficulties finding and selecting the browse button since JAWS skips over it and does not read it. Physical intervention was required to select the Browse button. The participant was able to complete the remaining steps of the task on her own.</LI></OL>





<B><P>Summary:</B><p>


<UL>

<LI>Illogical presentation of steps caused confusion for the participant</LI>

<LI>Use of unclear and ambiguous terminology</LI>

<LI>Defective browse button</LI></UL>


<B>

<P>Item 15 (Read messages posted to the bulletin Board. The Bulletin Board is linked from the Home page).</P>



<OL>



</B><LI>Participant was confused by the screen &quot;I don’t know where I am&quot;.</LI>

<LI>Researcher explained what the screen looked like with the different frames. The researcher also explained how names and titles of messages appeared on the screen.</LI>

<LI>The participant attempted to read a message. The message opened but JAWS did not automatically read the message, which caused further frustration for the user. She thought that the message had not yet opened when in fact it had been opened but was in a frame located at the bottom of the screen. JAWS continued to read the frame containing the list of names/messages and then eventually proceeded to reading the message that had been &quot;opened&quot; some time before. This was particularly problematic because in this case, this meant reading a list of over 20 messages before getting to the opened one. This created confusion for the participant who was unsure about whether her attempt to open a message to be read was successful.</LI></OL>





<B><P>Summary:</P>





<UL>

</B><LI>Participant was confused by the complexity of the screen (There seems to be a large amount of information on the screen as JAWS just kept reading on and on).</LI>

<LI>When a message is opened, JAWS does not automatically read that message but rather continues reading the current frame. This created a lot of confusion for the participant who expected some immediate notification that the command to open a message had been recognized.</LI></UL>





<B>


<P>Item 17 (Post a Bulletin Board Message).</P>



<OL>



</B><LI>Because in a previous question, the frames option was turned off, the subject could not find a button that directly allow her to compose a message. The only options present on the page were All, Main and Notes. A hint to try choosing one of these was given. Once this was chosen, the subject could again access the icon necessary for composing.</LI>

<LI>The Subject box and Edit box for entering the message were both referred to as the &quot;Subject&quot;.</LI>

<LI>There was no confirmation after posting the message that it had been successful. The only option to verify would be to read the &quot;unread &quot; messages which means that the participant would have to go through all the Unread messages to find and locate their own (as a method of verifying that their message had been successfully posted).</LI></OL>



<B>

<P>Summary:</P>





<UL>

</B><LI>Not being able to compose directly when the no frames option is turned on (extra step in between)</LI>

<LI>Inconsistency with the use of terminology (use &quot;subject&quot; for both the subject and the edit box for the message)</LI>

<LI>No confirmation after posting that it was a success.</LI></UL>







<B><P>Item 24 (Complete the online Quiz linked from the Home page or Tools page).</B><p>
<OL>



<LI>JAWS did not read the entire page. Participant was forced to tab through the links. It was necessary to use the mouse cursor to read the questions.</LI>

<LI>Radio buttons were read as 1 and 2 and not True and False. As a result subject did not know which button was associated with what choice.</LI></OL>





<B><P>Summary:</B><p>


<UL>

<LI>Inconsistency of JAWS due to the interactions with the software.</LI>

<LI>Radio buttons not associated with a label.</LI></UL>




<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>WEB COURSE IN A BOX</B><p>
<B><P>Item 6 (View the course &quot;Calendar&quot; and read any events it lists).</P>



</B><P>Problems encountered with this item are as follows:</P>



<OL>



<LI>This participant experienced significant difficulties with JAWS. In some cases these difficulties were a result of the participant’s inexperience with this particular screen reader and in other cases this problems was exasperated by the inconsistency that resulted from the interaction between JAWS and the software.</LI>

<LI>JAWS did not read the entire screen even after the commands necessary were given. As a result the participant could not form a visual map of what the screen might look like. </LI>

<LI>The participant was instructed to try tabbing through the links on the screen but JAWS only read two dates on the calendar (8 and 22) and skipped over all the other ones.</LI>

<LI>This created even more confusion for the participant, which resulted in frustration.</LI>

<LI>The participant attempted to switch cursors so that she can get JAWS to read but was unsuccessful in most cases. This switching of cursors only added to the confusion since the participant had significant difficulties keeping track of which cursor was presently in use and which cursor was necessary for a particular task.</LI></OL>





<B><P>Summary:</P>





<UL>

</B><LI>The problems encountered by this participant on this item was a result of a number of factors including lack of experience with the navigation of JAWS;</LI>

<LI>Lack of knowledge pertaining to which JAWS cursor should be used and when it should be used</LI>

<LI>Problems that stemmed from the interaction between JAWS and the software which prevented the participant from forming an organized visual map of the content of the screen</LI>

<LI>Frustration that resulted from the difficulties being encountered with the courseware and from the participant’s own personal problems, both of which significantly impacted her performance.</LI></UL>





<B>

<P>Item 7 (Review the &quot;Student&quot; directory to see who else is in the course).</B><p>
<OL>



<LI>This item created a lot of confusion for this participant. </LI>

<LI>There were problems with the software that prevented the participant from using the Internet Explorer Toolbar to navigate. This was her preferred toolbar for navigating within the courseware but it had become temporarily inactive.</LI>

<LI>Once again JAWS failed to read the entire page. The subject had to be instructed once again to tab through the various links on the screen but this technique significantly hampered the subject’s need to form a visual map.</LI>

<LI>The participant tabbed through the page once as prompted by the researcher but was not able to organize in her mind the contents of the present screen.  The participant did not realize that all the icons were listed separately by student name (everyone had their own link to student tools etc).  </LI>

<LI>She tried on numerous occasions to use the heading ‘Student Directory’ as a link when it was not.</LI></OL>





<B><P>Summary: </P>





<UL>

</B><LI>Some problems with the software (inactive Internet Toolbar) created confusion for the participant since this was her preferred<B> </B>method of navigation.</LI>

<LI>Again, because JAWS failed to read the content of the page, the subject was not able to form a visual map of what the screen looked like. This created a lot of confusion for the participant as she tried to navigate within the courseware.</LI>

<LI>The subject tried on numerous occasions to select text that were not links. This shows the participant’s inattention to details that would identify or fail to identify the information as active links and her obvious preoccupation with other thoughts (personal problems).</LI></UL>



<B>

<P>Item 8 (Access the student tools from the student directory and update your home page).</P>



<OL>



</B><LI>Participant is not able to form a visual map of the current screen because of JAWS inconsistency (not reading the page).</LI>

<LI>Subject did not realize that icons were repeated for each subject. As a result she tried to get into the first Student Tools that she could find but unknowingly which was not her own. When she understood that this was actually someone else’s student tools, the participant became very confused and frustrated.</LI>

<LI>The layout of the screen was described to the participant and detailed instructions were needed to access her own student tools. </LI>

<LI>The participant does not read the entire page, when it is a new one, to get familiarized with its content. This then interferes with her ability to navigate since she does not form a visual map of the screen’s layout. </LI>

<LI>Subject was asked to change a few things on her home page. Subject was not able to do very much here. JAWS once again failed to read the entire page. The participant tabbed through the links on the page but it made no sense to her. For instance, JAWS read combo box but it doesn’t read the text that explains what the combo box would be used to do (since this is not a link and JAWS was only reading links).  As a result, the participant heard combo box and was able to make changes but she did not know what she was going to be changing. The participant again became very frustrated. </LI>

<LI>The participant was instructed to try a few other things to get JAWS to read but these were all unsuccessful. The researcher also suggested that she might try switching cursors to read the text but the participant was not able to do this and consequently gave up. We moved on to the next question.</LI></OL>





<B><P>Summary: </P>





<UL>

</B><LI>Again, problems with this item were a result of both problems with the software and problems that were participant-oriented. </LI>

<LI>Subject was not motivated to do this task. She did not try to form visual maps even in cases when JAWS made it possible (JAWS reading page). In many cases she did not even read the entire page so as to get familiarized with its content but rather tried to complete the exercises without this. This created many difficulties later on as the subject tried to complete the exercises (accessing someone else’s student tools and not knowing it).</LI>

<LI>JAWS again created problems. It did not read the entire screen and the necessary commands were not successful when implemented. Since the subject had to revert back to tabbing through links, subject was unaware of the content of the screen other than the links. Hence, the subject was able to access the combo boxes and edit boxes and make potential changes but was not aware of what it was that she was changing since JAWS does not read the text that explains this functionality. </LI>

<LI>Because the subject has significant difficulties manipulating the various JAWS cursors, she was not able to get JAWS to read the content in a different cursor. The participant became frustrated and could not complete the task.</LI></UL>



<B>



<P>Item 9 (Submit an assignment (any file will do)).</P>



<OL>



</B><LI>JAWS fail to read the new page automatically. Subject becomes frustrated very quickly. Instructions are given to tab through the links to see what is on the page.</LI>

<LI>Subject is able to get to the appropriate page but becomes disoriented once she is there and does not know what the next step should be. The participant relies on step by step instruction for completing the task.</LI>

<LI>Once she is advised that she must upload a file to be submitted, subject does this but then becomes stuck. This however is due to the fact that JAWS does not read the ‘Browse’ button. She is able to tab to it but JAWS does not read it but is instead silent. The participant does not notice that there is a Browse bottom that should be there and she did not have an organized list of steps in her head that she should be taking to complete this task. She also does not notice that there was a slight pause as she had tabbed to the silent browse button. The researcher instructed the participant that she needed to browse to obtain the file to be uploaded and that there in fact was a problem with the browse button.</LI>

<LI>Instructed that it would be possible to access and locate the browse button if she had route JAWS to PC cursor but the participant refused to try this technique since she usually has a lot of difficulty with it. After a while the participant was convinced to try this technique and was eventually able to read the browse button but then she was unable to select it when she switched back to her regular cursor.</LI>

<LI>Alternatively, the participant was instructed that she could access the browse button if she listened carefully for the silent pause as she tabbed through the links on the page. This also was not successful without the prompting and guidance of the researcher (okay so you are on the browse button now). When she entered on this, another defect in the functioning resulted. A message saying that the file had been submitted appeared. Hence, even if one was able to access the browse button with some guidance using the keyboard, it resulted in an error submission.</LI>

<LI>The researcher asked if she could look at it (to physically intervene) but the participant refused any help. The item was eventually skipped.</LI></OL>





<B><P>Summary</B>:</P>





<UL>

<LI>More Problems with JAWS and its failure to read the page.</LI>

<LI>Participant was frustrated because of: the layout of the screen which she said was very confusing for her (but she really didn’t spend a lot of time trying to figure out what was on the screen); built-up frustration from previous items; frustrations from problems other than the ones encountered in today’s module.  </LI>

<LI>Participant relies on step by step instruction for completing the task. She does not try to form a visual map and does not try to think through the task at hand. She does not think of the task in steps and in terms of what the next step should be. Consequently, she does not know that the screen is missing a browse button because she was not looking for one.  Participant is not motivated to do this exercise and seems very preoccupied with other things.</LI>

<LI>Problem with the courseware: The browse button is defective. JAWS was unable to read it and accessing it with the keyboard (under close guidance) results in an error submission.  </LI>

<LI>Participant is instructed to use a different cursor but her lack of experience with JAWS and switching between cursors resulted in even more frustrations.</LI></UL>



<B>



<P>Item 10 (Create a Project page).</B><p>
<OL>



<LI>Participant had a lot of difficulties getting JAWS to read the entire page. </LI>

<LI>The participant also needed instructions for finding the appropriate icon although she had come across it numerous times. This shows that the participant did not even have a visual map for the top menu bar, which remained consistent and appeared on most of the pages.</LI>

<LI>Researcher suggested that she read through the page so that she can get an idea of what is on the screen. Participant did this but unwillingly. She constantly complained that JAWS was not the screen reader of her choice and how much she disliked working with it.</LI>

<LI>The participant switched between cursors repeatedly and eventually became very confused with keeping track of which cursor was in use (She had lots of difficulty entering data because she was in the wrong cursor).</LI>

<LI>This participant also experienced some difficulty with combo boxes. She could not change the data and did not know how to access the options that it contained. She was instructed to try the down arrow but this did not work because she was in the wrong cursor and would not acknowledge this.</LI></OL>





<B><P>Summary:</P>





<UL>

</B><LI>JAWS again consistently created problems (with its failure to read the page).</LI>

<LI>Participant was not motivated to complete the task. This is gathered from the observations that: she does not try to create a visual map of what is on the screen even for menus that remain consistent throughout the module; Although she has come across this menu many times, the participant does not pay attention to the details of its content and did not recognize that the link for creating a project page was in there; participant is unwilling to try different techniques for accessing courseware and constantly complains of being angry, frustrated with either JAWS or the layout of the screen.</LI>

<LI>Participant switched continuously and haphazardly from one cursor to another cursor and loses track of which one is in use. </LI>

<LI>The participant has some experience with JAWS but demonstrates great difficulty manipulating and switching between the various cursors. This creates difficulty when it comes to entering data, which requires that a particular cursor be in use. The participant lacks the knowledge about the particular function of the various cursors, which is a result of her lack of experience with JAWS.</LI></UL>







<B><P>Item 11 (Create your Portfolio).</P>



<OL>



</B><LI>Again JAWS created problems (failed to read the content of the screen). Because of this, JAWS was only reading links on the page and not any surrounding text. So again, in some cases, the participant knew that there were combo boxes to change or modify something but did not know what.</LI>

<LI>The participant relied on step by step instructions for completing the task. She did not want to explore the screen so that she would be able to work independently. The participant also refused to change cursors (route JAWS to PC) so that she could read the surrounding text instead the researcher had to read and explain to her, the contents of the surrounding text.   </LI>

<LI>Because the participant did not take the time to familiarize herself with the contents of the screen she was not aware that there was an update button at the bottom of the screen that needed to be selected after all the necessary changes had been made to the portfolio. The participant made the necessary changes to the portfolio and then thought that she had completed the task. Again instructions were needed to tab to the bottom of the page in order to submit the changes.</LI>

<LI>Once the changes had been submitted, a screen saying that the page had been updated flashed on and then the portfolio was displayed in a new window. The update confirmation screen was not read automatically by JAWS and hence the participant did not know that the changes were indeed confirmed. Also the portfolio is automatically displayed in a new window. The participant again was not forewarned in any way that this would be displayed and hence some confusion was created.</LI></OL>





<B><P>Summary:</B><p>


<UL>

<LI>Problems created by JAWS (not reading)</LI>

<LI>Participant only able to tab through the links on the page. This does not give a clear picture as to the contents of the page since tabbing through only reads the links and not any of the surrounding text. Hence the subject knew that there were links and combo boxes but did not know what these would be used for (this material is in the surrounding text which was not read).</LI>

<LI>Subject was unmotivated and relied on step by step instructions for completing the task. The subject’s failure to explore the page and create a visual map of its content resulted in pertinent errors such as failure to submit the changes with the update button at the bottom of the screen. The subject was unaware that this button existed.</LI>

<LI>Subject was expecting statement that said that changes were confirmed. This statement appeared briefly but Jaws did not read it automatically and before too long it was gone. The automatic display of the portfolio page created further confusion since unlike other modules, the option to view portfolio was bypassed. </LI></UL>





<B>



<P>Item 15 (Change your password).</P>



<OL>



</B><LI>JAWS again failed to read the entire page and the necessary commands did not work.</LI>

<LI>Participant is unmotivated. She could not remember where the icon to change your password might be although it was on the previous page that she was on. This is because she quite often used the list link option and hence only finds and is only aware of what she is looking for. The participant expressed constant frustration with JAWS and threatened to quit the exercises.</LI>

<LI>Participant experienced some difficulty moving back to the page that she was informed contained the icon that she needed to change her password. The IE toolbar was inactive and the screen contained no button that would allow her to move back. The researcher had to physically intervene and was able to move back with the use of the file/edit menu of the Internet explorer.</LI>

<LI>The participant was able to change her password but again became angry when JAWS would not read the page. Another issue is the use of a ‘send’ button to submit changes to the password. The use of this word made no sense and was confusing to the participant who expected to see something like ‘submit’, ‘submit changes’, ‘Update’.</LI></OL>





<B><P>Summary:</P>





<UL>

</B><LI>Some of the problems experienced were a result of difficulties with JAWS (failure to read when commanded)</LI>

<LI>Participant was unmotivated. She expressed repeated disdain with JAWS and was very easily frustrated. She was dependent upon step by step instructions, which was a result of the fact that she was not interested in forming visual maps or exploring the content of the screens. She always used the list link option, which she thought made things much simpler for her. This list link would be an asset when the user is already familiar with what the page looks like. In such cases, the list link provides a quick way of accessing links that are on the page. However, when the list link option is used as it was by this participant, it is more of a deterrent than it is helpful.  This is because it prevents the natural exploration of the page, which is necessary for the participant to form a visual map of the content of the screen. </LI>

<LI>Problems with the software: Inactive IE toolbar; No ‘back’ icon or option on the page (Student Guide); use of inappropriate ‘send’ button to confirm changes to the password.</LI></UL>







<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Top Class</B><p>
<P>The participant found this module very frustrating. She started the exercises and went up to Item 10 but it was decided that it might be better for her to come back to this on another day when she is less frustrated. The participant returned a month later, after the end of our last testing session, with the intention of completing the module but it was no longer available.</P>

<P>Item 7 (Attach a file to send along with your Email message).</P>



<OL>



</B><LI>This participant experienced problems with the browse button. JAWS was not able to read the browse button.

<P>Item 7 (Read through the Course Overview).</P>



<OL>



</B><LI>Participant experienced some difficulty finding the Course Overview.</LI>

<LI>Step by Step Instructions were needed to locate. Participant did not explore the screen and was having some difficulties with viewing the combo boxes. The Course Overview option was located within the Combo box and hence this made it difficult for the participant to locate.</LI></OL>





<B><P>Summary:</B><p>


<UL>

<LI>Problems experienced with this item were a result of difficulties associated with the characteristics of the participant. The participant did not attempt to explore the screen and hence when the list links option failed to come up with ‘Course Overview’, she was lost. This lack of motivation seem to be a result of the participant’s fragile emotional state and negative attitude with regard to the exercises and especially with regards to JAWS. She found it too effortful to try to construct a visual map and instead seem to prefer requesting the step by step instructions.</LI></UL>

<P>Item 13 (From the Courses Building Page, access the Site map and identify the Library).</P>



<OL>



</B><LI>This participant had very little difficulty accessing the Site map. However she was unable to identify the Library because none of the icons on the site map were linked. </LI>

<LI>JAWS also would not read the contents of the site map so the participant was not able to identify anything on the map.</LI>

<LI>From the site map, the participant was instructed to try accessing the library from a different page. She tried to access the Campus icon at the top of the screen (to get to the campus page) but this along with all the other icons in the top menu were defective. When they were selected, a message saying please wait (in French) came on and stayed on indefinitely.</LI></OL>





<B><P>Summary:</B><p>


<UL>

<LI>The icons on the site map were all inactive. Hence, the participant was not able to identify any of the contents because JAWS did not read the screen and the option of tabbing through the page to get an idea of its contents was not an option here (since there were no links within the site map).</LI>

<LI>It would be very convenient if a user can actually access different icons from the site map. This would be convenient and useful not only for the visually impaired but also the sighted and mentally challenged users who may also have difficulties finding a particular icon or who may find the organization of the site map much more user friendly.</LI>

<LI>Icons in the top menu (on the Site Map page) were also defective (e.g. Campus).  </LI></UL>

</B><LI>Problems experienced with JAWS (and its failure to read the screen automatically or even after the necessary commands were given).</LI>

<LI>Participant used the list link option and was unable to find ‘grades’ because it was actually called ‘Mallard Grades’ and not just ‘Grades’. Instructions were needed to get to Grades.</LI></OL>





<B><P>Summary:</P>





<UL>

</B><LI>JAWS continued to present problems.</LI>

<LI>Inconsistency of terminology was problematic. For participants who rely on options like ‘link list’, getting the exact name is important. Hence, ‘grades’ and not ‘Mallard Grades’ should be consistently used throughout the modules. But the difficulties encountered with this item were more a problem with the participant’s lack of interest in exploration.</LI></UL>





<B>

<P>Item 13 (Change your icon bar to show double columns).</P>



<OL>



</B><LI>Participant could not select option to show double columns instead of single column.</LI>

<LI>She was having trouble with data entry.</LI>

<LI>She was also not sure what showing double columns meant. This was explained to her by the researcher. With instructions, the participant was able to select the option.</LI></OL>





<B><P>Summary:</B><p>


<UL>

<LI>Participant was using the wrong JAWS cursor and had to be instructed to change cursors in order to do any data entry.</LI>

<LI>Participant was also unclear about how the task was actually going to change the current settings on the screen. This could be a factor of experience in a web-based environment. Note that the participant has a graduate degree in Computer Engineering and manages her own on-line business hence experience is not a major issue at hand. So even with experience, some of the features are still new and potentially problematic for her.</LI></UL>









<P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Summary of Overall problems experienced by this subject</P>



<OL>



</B><LI>JAWS was very unreliable. On many occasions it failed to automatically read new pages, even after the necessary command was given. The participant was forced to tab through the links on the screen to get some indication of what its contents were. This interfered with the participant’s need to form a visual map of the content of the screen because tabbing through only read the active links on the screen and not any of the surrounding text or contents of combo boxes (See Item 7, VirtualU, Item 24, WEB-CT). This in turn created a lot of difficulties and confusion for the participant.</LI>

<LI>The participant experienced a lot of difficulties with JAWS. JAWS is not her screen reader of choice but she has had some exposure and experience with it.  Nevertheless, her limited knowledge and experience was not sufficient to allow her to navigate successfully with JAWS. Specifically, this participant did not understand the varied functionality of the different JAWS cursors. She did not know which cursor should be used and when particular cursors should be used. As a result, she switched haphazardly from cursor to cursor when problems were encountered. This created further confusion for her as she could not keep track of which cursor was currently in use (see Item 10, WCB). She experienced extensive problems with data entry because of her lack of experience with the navigation of the different cursors (didn’t know that need particular cursor for data entry, Item10, WCB).</LI>

<LI>The participant was experiencing some personal emotional difficulties, which left her very angry and with a very low threshold for frustration. This volatile level of frustration was quickly and easily exaggerated with the difficulties that she experienced with JAWS.  Her frustration significantly impacted her performance and motivation to complete the task (e.g. Item 4, Mallard).</LI>

<LI>The interaction between JAWS and the Software also caused specific problems, which include: Inactive Internet Tool Bars, which forced the participant to alter her usual method of navigation.</LI>

<LI>The participant tried on numerous occasions to select text as links (e.g. Student Directory: WCB). This shows the participant’s lack of attention to details that might identify or fail to identify the information as active links. This can be another symptom of the participant’s preoccupation with other thoughts (personal).</LI>

<LI>Subject was not motivated to do the task. She did not try to formulate visual maps even in cases where JAWS made it possible (JAWS was actually Reading). In many cases, she did not even read the entire page so as to get familiarized with its content but rather tried to complete the exercises without this (Item11, WCB) or with the use of the ‘list link’ option (See summary for Item 15 for details, WCB). Consequently, she experienced a lot of difficulties when she tried to complete the exercises (e.g. not knowing that she was accessing someone else’s student tools. She was not aware that every subject had his or her own student tools etc.). </LI>

<LI>The subject also experienced some difficulty entering data. For instance, in some cases the subject was aware of the presence of combo boxes and edit boxes but was not aware of the purpose of these boxes since the functionality of the boxes were explained in the surrounding text, not being read by JAWS (WCB, Item 8). The participant was encouraged to try reading the text with a different JAWS cursor but was unsuccessful due to lack of experience which resulted in even more frustration with the task (see also Item 10, WCB). Difficulties with data entry were also encountered because the participant did not know how to select radio buttons (see Item 4, Mallard and Item 23, Course Info).</LI>

<LI>Not only does the participant fail to form a visual map (sometimes because of JAWS and also because she does not want to invest the time nor energy) but she also does not try to think through the task at hand in terms of what the next steps should be to completing it (Item 9, WCB). Hence when trying to complete Item 9, the participant does not know that JAWS is skipping the Browse button because she was not looking for one. As a result, the subject required step by step instructions for completing the task.</LI>

<LI>Another problem that the participant experienced as a result of problems with the actual courseware: defective browse button (Item 9, WCB; Item 7, Top Class; Item 14, WEB-CT). JAWS is not able to read it and accessing it with the keyboard (under close guidance and prompting by the researcher) results in an error submission. Other problems result from the interaction between JAWS and the Courseware (e.g. Inactive IE toolbar, Item 15, WCB). Other problems can be seen in the Site Map of Virtual U where all the icons are inactive and hence unreadable by the visually impaired (Item 13, Virtual U). The top navigation menu of the Site map (Virtual U) is also defective (see Summary of Item 13 for Recommendation). A number of icons in the Workspace are also inactive (Calendar, Caf&eacute;, Glossary and Set Options) if accessing from the keyboard but are active if accessing with the mouse. Hence for the visually impaired user, intervention is required (see Item 15, 31, 33, 34). Other problems with the software include: no access to the whiteboard (Course Info, Item 13); unable to read or post messages to the Chat room because of unclear layout of the screen. For the chat room, the keyboard is only able to access two boxes, one is called ‘Location’, which meant nothing to the participant, and the other had no title. The participant was eventually able to post a message with instructions from the researcher but could not read it (see Item 11 and 12, Course Info). For more difficulties accessing the CHAT room (see WEBCT, Items 11 and 12). The participant was unable to access the White Board with the use of the keyboard (Item 13, Course Info and Item 10, Web-CT). Could not use the electric blackboard. Cursor only went to ‘save’ and ‘close’ options but not the edit box hence physical intervention (putting the cursor in the edit box) was required, Item 14, Course Info; problems with absence of alt-text and the inclusion of JavaScript/symbols instead, Item 5, Course Info. </LI>

<LI>Another problem was the use of confusing terminology: For instance the use of a ‘send’ button to confirm the changes to the password instead of ‘update’ or something more meaningful (see item 15, WCB). Inconsistency of the use of terminology is also seen in Item 5, Mallard and Item 3 for Course Info (uses of access assignment and access exercise simultaneously).</LI></OL>
