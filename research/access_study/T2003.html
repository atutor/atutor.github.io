</B><P>Summary of problems observed in each of the various protocols and the corresponding sources of these problems for each of the subjects.</P>

<P>Major accessibility problems (requiring either instructions or physical intervention) were <B>not</B> encountered by this participant in the following courseware packages<B>: Web Course in a Box, Top Class and Mallard.</B><p><P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Course Inf.</P>
</B>
<B><P>Item 2 (Login).</P>

<P> No rank given because login was already completed.</P>


<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Web-CT</P>
</B>
<B><P>Item 14 (Submit a file using the Assignment Drop-box that is linked from the Tools page).</P>

</B><P>This participant, like 2009 and 2007, had difficulties with Item 14 from this module. This was due to multiple problems as was previously explained (see summaries for 2009 and 2007):</P>




<P>1.The steps required for submitting an assignment were not clear. The subject was instructed to use the Assignment Drop-box linked from the Tools page to submit a file. The subject went to the assignment drop-box found on the Tools page. This step was not problematic. Upon reaching the page however, the subject became confused since the next step to the whole process was not obvious to her. She was looking for an option that said something like ‘submit file’ since this is what she understood the exercise to be about but could not find anything even remotely connected.</P>



<P>Unlike 2009, this participant did not eventually click into "access exercise" to find the remaining steps to upload and eventually submit a file since this did not seem like the next logical step but instead moved on to the next question as prompted by the researcher who was also confused by this item. </P>
<B>
<P>Summary and Recommendations:</P>
</B>
<P>This item was particularly problematic because of the not so logical display of steps for completing the task at hand. The term ‘Access exercise’ complicated the situation further because it seemed out of place and out of context and was not understood by the participant to indicate that  &quot;this is where you would access the file to be submitted&quot;. The layout and information on the screen was also particularly confusing. Some of the information presented on the screen is seen to be helpful (grades etc.) but out of place. </P>

<P>The difficulty experienced with this item would be a sole result of the courseware and not the experience or abilities of the participant. If allowed to experiment, the participant can potentially figure out the steps needed (as did 2009) but it is not obvious and can be especially confusing for a novice, an individual with learning difficulties or an individual with a low threshold for frustration.</P>

<P>Item 6 (Send an email to the instructor)</P>
</B>
<P>Problems experienced with this item were a direct result of problems with the software. Participant has no difficulties finding and selecting the appropriate icons for sending an email but error message alert (saying that the return address is not recognizable) consequently prevented the completion of this task.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Overall Summary of Problems Encountered</P>
</B>

<P>The difficulties experienced with this these two items are a sole result of the courseware and not the experience or abilities of the participant. Difficulties with the courseware include: illogical display of steps for completing the task; ambiguous and confusing use of terminology; error with the connection of the email.</P>
