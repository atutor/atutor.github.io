<h2>Proposal Submitted to the Office of Learning Technology:</h2>

<p><a name="EXECUTIVE"></a> </p>





    <h3 class=init>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h3>



  <P>With the recent increase in the popularity of Web based instruction and computer 

    accessed information in general, it is becoming increasingly important for 

    the electronic community to become aware of the barriers people with disabilities 

    face in these virtual environments. As technologies emerge to deliver Web 

    based instruction, it is also important to educate both courseware developers 

    and educators of solutions they can apply to insure that persons with disabilities 

    are not excluded from participating in this new and quickly developing form 

    of education.</P>

  <P>The objectives of this study are to: 1) investigate barriers faced by individuals 

    in Web based learning environments, 2) educate the general public and governing 

    bodies of accessibility issues associated with Web based instruction, 3) make 

    recommendations to courseware developers on methods to increase their products 

    support of accessible design, 4) to provide guidelines for course designers 

    and instructors to ensure the accessibility of their curriculum materials.</P>

  <P>The partners of this project are experts in the field of disability, education, 

    assistive technology, and Web based instruction. Partners include the Adaptive 

    Technology Resource Centre (ATRC), The Centre for Academic Technology (CAT), 

    and the Special Needs Opportunity Windows Project (SNOW), each affiliated 

    with the University of Toronto. Partners also include the Canadian National 

    Institute for the Blind (CNIB), the Learning Disabilities Association of Ontario 

    (LDAO), and Bruce Landon, educator and researcher in the field of distance 

    education and Web based delivered instruction. </P>

  <P>The project is an extension of the work Bruce Landon conducted in 1998, which 

    looked at the pedagogical aspects of Web Based courseware tools. Admittedly 

    missing from his research is an assessment of the accessibility of these tools 

    for learners with disabilities who might use them. To accomplish this assessment 

    through the current study, two participants from each of four disability groups 

    will be trained on appropriate assistive technologies and asked to create, 

    and participate in mock online courses created in a number Web based courseware 

    tools.</P>

  <P>Participants in the study will represent the following disability groups: 

    Blind, Vision Impaired, Mobility Impaired, and Learning Disabled. The technologies 

    with which individuals of these groups will access the courseware tools will 

    depend on the nature of their disabilities. Assistive technologies could include 

    voice recognition, screen reading, screen enhancement, onscreen keyboards, 

    or text-to-speech systems. </P>

  <P>The results of this study will have implications for the future development 

    of courseware, for training of educators who work in a Web setting with persons 

    who have disabilities, and will raise awareness in the general public and 

    governing bodies of issues associated with access to information by persons 

    with disabilities.</P>

  <a name="PROJECTB"></a> 



    <h3>PROJECT BACKGROUND</H3>



  <P>Networks such as the Web, Intranets or dedicated broad band networks are 

    being used to teach, to conduct research, to hold tutorials, to submit assignments 

    and to act as libraries. The primary users of Web based instruction include 

    universities, professional upgrading, employment training and lifelong learning. 

    Those that can benefit most from this trend are learners with disabilities. 

    Web based instruction is easily adapted to varying learning styles, rates, 

    and communication formats. Issues of distance, transportation and physical 

    access are reduced. Electronic text, unlike printed text, can be read by individuals 

    who are blind, vision impaired, dyslexic and by individuals who cannot hold 

    a book or turn pages. </P>

  <P>Unfortunately, Web delivered education is not barrier free. A preliminary 

    study conducted at the Centre for Academic Technology at the University of 

    Toronto (1998) revealed that none of the currently available Web based courseware 

    tools address accessibility. Given the rising popularity of online courses, 

    this represents a serious threat to inclusion that must be corrected before 

    courseware tools develop further. </P>

  <P>Fortunately courseware tools or applications used to teach at a distance 

    are in the early stages of development. If proactive steps are taken now, 

    more inclusive design conventions can be established. A consortium of partners 

    representing consumers, experts in the field, developers and leading providers 

    of distance education will address these barriers. This project will be an 

    extension of the research started by Dr. Bruce Landon, who assessed the pedagogical 

    effectiveness of online educational delivery applications (see http://www.ctt.bc.ca/landonline/). 

    The tools that were previously assessed will be further assessed for their 

    support of accessible design, from the perspective of administrator, designer 

    or instructor, and student.</P>

    <H3 >ACTION PLAN</H3>



  <H3>Setup:</H3>

  <P>Courseware demonstration server and software installation. The server will 

    be set up on a Pentium II 350 PC with the Linux operating System, and installed 

    at the ATRC. Courseware packages will be requisitioned from each of the 14 

    developers with the incentive of improving their product to reach the broadest 

    audience, and inclusion of all those who access courses created with their 

    products, with or without a disability. The 14 courseware tools assessed by 

    Landon will be installed on the courseware server. Courseware tools will include 

    Learning Space, WebCT, Top Class, Virtual-U, Web Course in a Box, CourseInfo, 

    First Class, Norton Connect, Allaire Forum, Team Wave, WebBoard, Asymetrix 

    ToolBook, Question Mark, and PlaceWare.</P>

  <P>Additionally, three Pentium II 350 machines will be set up at the ATRC for 

    user training and testing. Each machine will have installed one or more of 

    the popular assistive technologies from the following categories: 1) Screen 

    Readers (Jaws 3.2), 2) Screen Enhancers (ZoomText Extra), 3) Voice Recognition 

    (Dragon Dictate), 4) On Screen Keyboards (Wivik), and 5) Text-to-Speech (TextHelp).</P>

  <P>Time line: September 1, 1999 – December 31, 1999</P>

  <P>Greg Gay – Ian Graham</P>

  <H4>Subject Selection: </H4>

  <P>The project administrators at each of the partner sites will collaborate 

    on the selection of individuals to participate in the study. It is expected 

    that two or three participants will be selected from three of the partner 

    sites (CNIB, LDAO, ATRC), to represent a broad selection of disabilities. 

    Criteria for selection include those with disabilities that might be expected 

    to administer, design or instruct, or take an online course. Ages will span 

    from 18 through 55. Individuals selected will either be enrolled or teaching 

    at the college or university level and have a visual, mobility, or learning 

    impairment. It is assumed that participants at this level will be of average 

    or superior intelligence. </P>

  <P>The selection process will occur through marketing of the selected disability 

    groups, soliciting clientele of the partner organizations who are involved 

    in higher education, Special Services departments within Colleges and Universities, 

    and advocacy groups supporting persons with disabilities in the greater Toronto 

    Area.</P>

  <P>Time Line: September 15, 1999 – December 31,1999</P>

  <P>Laurie McArthur (ATRC) – Carol Yaworski (LDAO) – Karen Taylor (CNIB)</P>

  <h4>User Training:</H4>

  <p>The 8 participants will receive, in addition to basic Internet skills, training 

    from ATRC staff on their respective assistive technologies, and training from 

    the CAT staff on basic web based instructional design. Training will occur 

    on average over a period of five to eight 3-hour sessions depending on the 

    severity and type of disability, the type of assistive technology being used, 

    and the participants experience with computers and the Internet. It is expected 

    that most of the participants will be novice users requiring instruction in 

    technologies and the Internet. Participants will be judged as proficient in 

    their respective assistive technology, meeting the selection criteria, when 

    they are independently able to navigate and participate in a currently accessible 

    Web based course running through the SNOW project. </P>

  <P>As a side effect, the resulting skills will benefit participants by increasing 

    their qualifications or employability, and teach them skills to help them 

    adapt their environment to their disability.</P>

  <P>Time Line: January 1, 2000 – June 15, 2000</P>

  <P>Karen McCall (blind and low vision)</P>

  <P>Laurie McArthur (mobility impairment and print impairment)</P>

  <P>Laurie Harrison (Internet skills and instructional design)</P>

  <H4>Instrument development:</H4>

  <p>The instrument used to assess the accessibility of courseware tools will 

    be based on the WAI Accessibility Guidelines, which outline recommendations 

    for creating accessible Web based documents (Treviranus et al , 1999). </P>

  <P>Time Line: January 1, 2000 – June 15, 2000</P>

  <P>Greg Gay – Jutta Treviranus – Bruce Landon</P>

  <P>Observer Training: an independent observer will be trained to identify and 

    distinguish between difficulties associated with the use of assistive technologies, 

    and those associated with access to courseware tools. The observer will be 

    trained on the relevant assistive and Web technologies by the ATRC and SNOW 

    staff. Difficulties associated with the assistive technology will be identified 

    when a participant is unable to access a courseware user interface when the 

    assistive technology provides the means. Difficulties associated with access 

    to courseware tools will be identified when the assistive technology will 

    not access particular features of the courseware user interface.</P>

  <P>Time Line: January 1, 2000 – June 15, 2000</P>

  <P>Greg Gay – Laurie McArthur – Observer</P>

  <H4>User Testing:</H4>

  <p>Each of the participants trained on their respective assistive technologies 

    will create a course module in each of the courseware tools from pre-existing 

    curriculum materials. Users will be assessed by the observer who will record 

    their ease or difficulty in accessing each of the tools outlined by Landon 

    (1998) at three levels: 1) as a course administrator, 2) as a course instructor 

    or designer, and 3) as a student. In five to ten three hour sessions (depending 

    on the rate at which the participant progresses), the trained observer will 

    guide each participant through the creation and participation in a Web based 

    course module using each of the courseware tools being assessed. A module 

    is synonymous with a weekly class meeting in the traditional educational setting, 

    providing course notes, discussions, resources, exercises, and testing. </P>

  <P>Time Line: June15, 2000 - January 15, 2001</P>

  <P>Greg Gay – Observer</P>

  <H4>Analysis:</H4>

  <p>For each of the courseware tools assessed, quantitative data will be compiled 

    in two scores for each category outlined by Landon (1998): a functionality 

    score and an accessibility score, or the presence of pedagogical features 

    and the extent to which each of these features support (or fails to support) 

    access by individuals using assistive technologies. </P>

  <P>Qualitative data collected in this study will be summarized for specific 

    concerns stated by the disabled participants, providing first hand experience 

    from which to base recommendations made to educators and courseware developers.</P>

  <P>Time Line: January 1, 2001 - March 31, 2001</P>

  <P>Greg Gay – Ian Graham – Jutta Treviranus – Bruce Landon</P>

  <H4>Dissemination:</h4>

  <p>Outlined below.</P>

  <P>Time Line: Jan 1, 2001 - September 15, 2001</P>

  <P>Greg Gay – Bruce Landon – Jutta Treviranus - Karen McCall - Karen Taylor- 

    Carol Yaworski</P>

  <a name="EVALUATION"></a> 



    <H3 >EVALUATION PLAN</H3>



  <P>For each of the courseware tools assessed, quantitative data will be compiled 

    in two scores for each category outlined by Landon (1998). The total of all 

    tools present represents a measure of functionality, and the extent to which 

    tools support users of assistive technologies represents a measure of accessibility. 

  </P>

  <P>The rationale for this functionality/accessibility approach encompasses the 

    pedagogy and accessibility of the tools in question. Since a highly accessible 

    courseware tool with a small number of authoring utilities offers limited 

    support for pedagogy, and a highly functional authoring tool that offers few 

    accessibility concessions effectively promotes inaccessibility, designers 

    and instructors must evaluate courseware tools on both dimensions. These scores 

    will compliment the qualitative data already assembled by Landon (1998), providing 

    educators and course designers with summary figures for quick comparisons 

    of functionality and accessibility across courseware tools. </P>

  <P>Qualitative data from interviews conducted with each participant following 

    use of each tool will provide specific examples of inaccessible design in 

    online education. The Distance Education Survey (DES), a standardized 88 item 

    questionnaire developed in 1997 through the EvNet project at McMaster University, 

    will be adapted to the Web to gather participants personal information. The 

    DES questions participants about their experience with distance education, 

    learning preferences, access to computers, and personal attitudes towards 

    computers, providing additional qualitative data on participants attitudes 

    and beliefs (see http://socserv2.mcmaster.ca/srnet/evnet.htm) Qualitative 

    data will be summarized to provide specific case studies for educators and 

    courseware developers.</P>

  <a name="DISSEMINATION"></a> 



    <H3 >DISSEMINATION </h3>



  <P>First, results from this study will be disseminated among the developers 

    of the courseware tools assessed in this study, making them aware of the issues 

    surrounding accessibility, and methods to increase the accessibility of their 

    products. </P>

  <P>Secondly, additions will be made to the &quot;landonline&quot; site, where 

    Landon's results are currently published. This will include the addition of 

    functionality and accessibility data to be merged into the qualitative data 

    already present. The site will be publicized through the traffic on the SNOW 

    and ATRC Web sites, whose primary audiences are educators and individuals 

    with disabilities. The sites will be publicized through each of the major 

    Internet search engines, formatting search criteria to reach a broader general 

    population. </P>

  <P>Thirdly, results will be disseminated through the marketing system set up 

    for SNOW. This includes distribution to list-servers, email lists, and Usenet 

    groups associated with adult education, special needs, web-based instruction, 

    and Internet development. </P>

  <P>Fourthly, a summary of the study and its results will be submitted for publication 

    to the major journals associated with research in adult education, special 

    needs, Web based instruction, and Internet development. </P>

  <P>Results will be merged into the authoring guidelines currently being developed 

    for forth and fifth generation web browsers, through the W3C WAI group. These 

    guidelines reach those responsible for creating and developing technologies 

    for the Web.</P>
