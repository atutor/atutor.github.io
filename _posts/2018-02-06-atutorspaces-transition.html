<h1>Transitioning from ATutorSpaces</h1>
<p>This post covers what ATutorSpaces users need to know about moving their courses from ATutorSpaces, into another ATutor site, or into another Learning Management System (LMS). These details will be relevant for anyone planning on moving or distributing their ATutor courses.</p>

<p>There are three primary ways to transition from your ATutorSpaces site:</p>
<ul><li>Export ATutor course Backups, to import into another ATutor system</li>
<li>Export Common Cartridges, to import into another LMS, or another ATutor system</li>
<li>Export a Site Bundle with the content directory and database, to copy a complete ATutor system from one place to another (fees apply).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Export ATutor Backups</h2>
<p>If you are moving from ATutorSpaces into another ATutor site, a preferred way to transition is to generate course backups on ATutorSpaces, then upload those backups and restore them in the new ATutor host site. </p>

<p>Backups contain: </p>
<ul class="c12 lst-kix_os7wtgtbw9oe-0 start"><li>Announcements</li>
<li>Assignments</li>
<li>Content</li>
<li>External Tools</li>
<li>File Manager Files</li>
<li>Forums</li>
<li>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</li>
<li>GameMe Settings</li>
<li>Glossary Terms</li>
<li>Groups</li>
<li>Links</li>
<li>Polls</li>
<li>Reading Lists</li>
<li>Statistics</li>
<li>Tests and Surveys</li>
</ul>

<p>Backups do include any data from addon modules. &nbsp;Backups do not&nbsp;include student information, grades, postings to forums, or other course generated data. A backup produces a fresh copy of a course, that would be used to create a new course session.</p>
<h3>Considerations: </h3>
<p>Servers may restrict the size of files that can be uploaded. If you receive a file size exceeded error message when uploading a backup, you may need to contact your system administrator and ask to have the PHP upload_max_filesize&nbsp;and post_max_size&nbsp;settings increased.</p>

<p>The size of backups can be reduced by removing any multimedia files you may have uploaded in a course, before generating a backup. A few audio files in your content is fine. One video however, can be 10 times the size of all the other files in a course. Many videos make courses very large and more difficult to manage. We recommend using services like YouTube and Vimeo for storing your videos, then linking or embedding those into your course content.</p>

<p>The steps described here for administrators, instructors may also complete for their own courses.</p>
